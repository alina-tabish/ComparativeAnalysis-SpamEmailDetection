# Comparative Analysis of Spam Email Detection 
[Notebook preview](https://nbviewer.org/github/alina-tabish/SpamEmailDetection/blob/main/Comparative-Analysis-SpamEmailDetection.ipynb)

### Domain -> Text Mining

The aim of this project is to test out different algorithms to detect spam emails. A comparative analysis is performed using various algorithms over a certain dataset. Every algorithm performs at a different efficiency level but their purpose is the same. Once the validation and analysis is done, we pick the best algorithm based on error rate, precision and recall, and most importantly, accuracy.

The raw dataset has been downloaded from Kaggle: [Enron-Spam Dataset](https://medium.com/r?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kaggle.com%2Fdatasets%2Fwanderfj%2Fenron-spam)

This dataset consists of raw information in a txt-form.
