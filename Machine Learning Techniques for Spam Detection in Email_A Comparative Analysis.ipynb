    "# Comparative Analysis of Detection of Email Spam\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Domain -> Text Mining\n",
    "\n",
    "These days email is the most powerful tool but it can become a source of a headache due to the endless spam emails. Companies and businesses send unwanted emails which aren't liked by anyone. So, we aim to test out different algorithms to detect spam emails. We perform comparative analysis using various algorithms over a certain dataset and cross validate for each. Every algorithm performs at a different efficiency level but their purpose is the same and that is to separate spam email. Once the validation and analysis is done, we pick the best algorithm based on error rate, precision and recall. "

to upper\\n $ 4 . 00 s\\n range . gas prices moving into this range would begin to attract demand back\\n into the market , diverting supplies from storage and increasing supply\\n concerns\\n again . to the upside , there is little demand response to price until\\n industrial\\n demand lessens or the price of distillate oil , as of this writing near $ 7 . 00\\n per\\n million british thermal units ( mmbtu ) , is breached . however , distillate\\n markets\\n themselves are extremely tight , and prices for that fuel would likely follow\\n gas\\n prices up . within this range , prices are defined mainly by supply anxiety \\x01 * the\\n market \\x01 , s judgment of the likelihood of a supply shortfall , which would be\\n characterized by extreme pricing and volatility , and a difficult process of\\n supply\\n allocation by price .\\n by now , exposure to extreme price volatility this winter is certain . although\\n cera expects storage injections to increase by approximately 2 . 0 billion cubic\\n feet ( bcf ) per day from august to september , this increase would still leave\\n inventories at record lows for this month and next . even this increase in\\n injections will not occur if a tropical storm forces evacuation of offshore\\n platforms , or if hot weather returns .\\n for october , heating load enters the picture . with us supplies running close\\n to\\n year - earlier levels and imports slightly higher , demand priced out of the\\n market\\n will remain the key reason that storage injections increase at all from last\\n year \\x01 , s\\n low level . as a result , although prices may close the month of september in\\n the\\n upper $ 4 . 00 s per mmbtu , at the high end of the competitive range with resid ,\\n any threat of interruption in supplies will quickly bounce prices upward\\n during\\n the remainder of september or in october . as the heating season begins ,\\n therefore , cera expects the reality of supply vulnerability for the winter to\\n result in the first ever monthly average price of $ 5 . 00 at the henry hub ( see\\n table 1 ) and the first of potentially many months at or above that price .\\n gas storage \\x01 * new record lows\\n cera estimates that storage inventories in the united states crossed into\\n record\\n low territory as of the end of august , when inventories of 2 , 233 bcf fell\\n below\\n the previous 1996 record low of 2 , 245 bcf ( see table 2 ) . more records will\\n likely be broken in the coming months , and by widening margins . injections for\\n september are expected to average 9 . 5 bcf per day , an increase of 2 . 0 bcf per\\n day from the august level but below last year \\x01 , s pace of 10 . 3 bcf per day .\\n cera \\x01 , s september estimate could be exceeded under mild weather conditions\\n with no tropical activity hitting the gulf of mexico , but injections would\\n likely\\n fall below the 9 . 5 bcf per day rate should storm activity force evacuation of\\n platforms . this rate would leave us inventories at 2 , 518 bcf at month \\x01 , s end , a\\n record low by 87 bcf .\\n for october , cera expects a slight increase in the injection rate from last\\n year .\\n injections of 5 . 5 bcf per day on average this year would be enabled by demand\\n priced out of the market and by a lack of unusually cool weather or tropical\\n storm activity . october injections have varied historically from 4 . 0 bcf per\\n day\\n ( 1989 ) to 8 . 5 bcf per day ( 1998 ) . even if injections reached toward the upper\\n end of this range , the market would remain exposed to shortfalls during the\\n winter . at the expected injection rate , us inventories of 2 , 689 bcf at the\\n end of\\n october would result in an end of march 2001 inventory level of 669 bcf under\\n normal winter weather , 89 bcf below the previous record low of 758 bcf .\\n regional markets \\x01 * waiting for winter\\n the pipeline explosion on el paso during late august intensified the\\n subregional\\n pressures already at play in western gas markets . cuts in pipeline flows\\n limited\\n access into california on the only pipeline route into the state with any\\n excess\\n capacity . the lack of supply pressured prices within the supply basins and\\n forced strong storage withdrawals in the california market . although summer\\n power loads in california will ease and much of the el paso capacity has been\\n restored , the race to improve storage positions before the onset of winter\\n heating\\n load will keep intense pressure on topock prices . differentials in the rest\\n of the\\n west will strengthen as local heating loads begin to absorb enough supply to\\n ease pipeline bottlenecks ( see table 3 ) .\\n differentials in the east , which have traded in a narrow range this summer ,\\n will\\n likely reach slightly higher levels with the start of the heating season in\\n october .\\n however , exposure to pricing disconnects will remain low until later this\\n year .\\n cera \\x01 , s outlook by region follows :\\n * rockies . pipeline bottlenecks out of the rocky mountains\\n this summer should begin to ease as heating loads climb\\n during october . cera expects that as local demand limits\\n pressure on pipeline capacity , differentials will narrow .\\n october differentials should average $ 0 . 50 per mmbtu .\\n * san juan . the resumption of flows on el paso \\x01 , s southern\\n system , combined with production outages , has relieved\\n some of the access constraints on san juan supply .\\n seasonal declines in rockies to southwest flows and the\\n beginning of the heating season should narrow october\\n differentials to $ 0 . 35 per mmbtu .\\n * permian and mid - continent . the continuing pull on\\n supplies from the west will support permian prices , and the\\n midwestern pull on supplies will support mid - continent\\n prices . cera expects a differential to the henry hub of\\n $ 0 . 06 per mmbtu for mid - continent supplies and $ 0 . 11\\n per mmbtu for permian supplies .\\n * chicago . the delay in the in - service date for alliance from\\n october 2 to october 30 will take some gas out of the\\n chicago market next month . this delay , combined with the\\n need to build midwest storage inventories , should sustain\\n the recent increase in differentials from the $ 0 . 05 \\x01 ) $ 0 . 08\\n range to above $ 0 . 10 per mmbtu . cera expects october\\n differentials at the chicago citygate to average $ 0 . 11 .\\n * northeast markets . gas prices near $ 5 . 00 have increased\\n the fuel cost of delivery from the gulf coast into the\\n northeast , raising the floor level for differentials to near\\n $ 0 . 30 per mmbtu . the beginning of the heating season and\\n the lack of new capacity into the new york citygate should\\n support differentials above the floor during october , at near\\n $ 0 . 40 per mmbtu .\\n canadian markets \\x01 * outages affect supply\\n outages have affected supply thus far in september . both british columbia and\\n alberta have been affected , resulting in a further year - over - year decline in\\n western canadian supply . the various problems appear to be rectified , but the\\n average supply for the month is likely to be down 100 to 150 million cubic\\n feet\\n ( mmcf ) per day from september 1999 .\\n drilling has been adversely affected over the past several weeks by wet\\n weather ,\\n but rig utilization is beginning to climb again to previous levels . more than\\n 8 , 400 gas wells are expected for this year .\\n slight drop in export demand\\n eastern canadian demand is still down approximately 200 mmcf per day , with\\n cooler - than - normal weather reducing the need for air conditioning . in the west\\n however , cooler - than - normal weather has accounted for an increase in demand\\n for heating requirements of about 200 mmcf per day .\\n exports are down slightly in september compared with september 1999 , with\\n pg & e gt - nw off 110 mmcf per day . northern border is running even with\\n september 1999 .\\n storage picture brighter in canada\\n storage injections in eastern canada have picked up , with inventories now\\n expected to reach the five - year average of 210 bcf . in the west , inventories\\n at\\n the end of the injection season will not only be above the five - year level but\\n should be even with those of 1999 , at 250 bcf .\\n wider differentials holding\\n after widening substantially in august to us $ 1 . 17 , the aeco - to - henry\\n differential has closed back to a more typical level of $ 0 . 60 in september .\\n september \\x01 , s aeco price should average us $ 4 . 15 per mmbtu ( c $ 5 . 79 per\\n gigajoule [ gj ] ) , increasing in october to us $ 4 . 35 per mmbtu ( c $ 6 . 07 per gj ) .\\n * * end * *\\n cera ' s autumn 2000 roundtable event dates and agendas are now available at\\n http : / / www . cera . com / event\\n account changes\\n to edit your personal account information , including your e -

       " 'Subject: alliance update\\n note : alliance announced an october 30 official in - service date for tariff\\n services ; however , they will be selling test gas in\\n ramp up period . right now , these first deliveries are going into the anr\\n system because it is the only interconnect that is\\n ready .\\n alliance delayed , but deliveries begin ramping up\\n after months of speculation in the industry , alliance pipeline confirmed\\n yesterday full commercial service will be delayed nearly a month until oct .\\n 30 . when construction of the system was scheduled nearly three years ago ,\\n oct . 2 was the target date for commercial service .\\n however , the delay doesn \\' t mean the market won \\' t be getting any canadian gas\\n out of alliance until the end of october . the pipeline opened one of its\\n chicago delivery valves last thursday and started selling 50 - 100 mmcf / d of\\n gas into the market . it intends to increase its sales each week eventually\\n reaching its full 1 . 325 bcf / d load prior to switching to commercial service\\n on oct . 30 , said spokesman jack crawford .\\n \" we got commission approval to actually sell our test gas . right now i think\\n we are dealing with three or four different marketers . our initial deliveries\\n right now are into the anr system . that \\' s because its basically the only\\n connection that is ready , but over the next few weeks we expect they will all\\n be ready to go and we will test them all .\\n \" i \\' d be surprised if it ends up being regular [ volume increases of 100 mmcf / d\\n each week ] but that \\' s kind of the game plan , \" said crawford . \" on oct . 29 it\\n will be alliance selling [ 1 . 325 bcf / d of ] test gas , and on oct . 30 it will be\\n shippers nominating at one end and delivering at the other . the market may\\n not see much of a difference . we obviously don \\' t want to start charging our\\n shippers until we have the confidence that all the systems have been checked\\n out . \"\\n the pipeline system is designed to deliver gas from producing regions of\\n northeastern british columbia and northwestern alberta to the chicago area\\n where the line interconnects with the north american pipeline grid .\\n currently , more than 99 % of the total pipeline system has been installed ,\\n including 14 mainline compressor stations , 37 receipt points in british\\n columbia and alberta , and 7 delivery points in illinois . commissioning\\n activities commenced in march , including the flowing of gas into the\\n completed sections of line to purge air from the pipe . at present ,\\n approximately 95 % of alliance has been purged of air . this includes all the\\n mainline portion of the system ( 1 , 857 miles ) from near gordondale , alberta to\\n the delivery section near joliet , illinois and 306 of 434 mile laterals\\n receipt portion of the system . additionally , 25 receipt point meter stations\\n have been commissioned . final commissioning activities are also being\\n completed at 14 mainline compressor stations . to date , 6 bcf of gas is in the\\n commissioned mainline and lateral portions of the system , with the ultimate\\n line pack targeted at 8 bcf .\\n crawford said there were a variety of factors that contributed to the delayed\\n start - up . \" the rain in saskatchewan delayed us a bit back in july , but we\\n managed to catch up on the construction there in august . but it then meant\\n that some of our commissioning didn \\' t get going until a little bit later .\\n farther west in alberta and bc in fact we \\' ve had a couple of rain problems .\\n in particular , we have one relatively small but fairly long lateral that we\\n haven \\' t even been able to get on the right of way yet and that \\' s because of\\n rain .\\n \" up in bc we \\' ve been having trouble with a directional drill of a creek on\\n one of our laterals up there , \" he said . \" we \\' re likely to get approval to\\n open - cut that creek , but that will take us probably the better part of a\\n month .\\n \" on the downstream end , we had hoped to get more of our downstream\\n connections right now . we are testing one , but some of the others aren \\' t\\n quite ready yet . we \\' re ready , but they are not . then of course there is a\\n fairly complex interaction between the pipeline and the [ aux sable liquids ]\\n plant . we haven \\' t had a chance to work on that yet . so when you look at all\\n of those things , the question was when could we establish a date when all\\n this stuff would be done and we would be operational . we spent a fair amount\\n of time with our shippers and they mentioned one other pipeline that was\\n being delayed one day at a time drove them to distraction . we agreed we would\\n pick one of three dates , all mondays : oct . 2 , oct . 16 or oct . 30 , and we just\\n had to pick one that we felt confident in . \"\\n besides the timing of service , there has been another important question on\\n the minds of many market observers . will the gas alliance ships come oct . 30\\n be incremental gas or gas that would have been flowing through transcanada .\\n \" i don \\' t think it \\' s going to be purely either way , \" said crawford . \" lots of\\n guys are targeting for nov . 1 to bring their new gas on to start the gas year\\n so it all depends on how much shows up . it \\' s not a big secret that we \\' ve had\\n some wet weather and some of the drilling and completion work hasn \\' t gotten\\n done . that \\' s likely to have some affect on it as well . that \\' s a delay though .\\n how long are people going to pay $ 6 for gas ? boy , people are going to have a\\n lot of money for drilling and projects . \"',\n",

       " 'Subject: security update\\n enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world . some of the changes took effect immediately ( e . g . additional security personnel ) and some are phasing in . while not all of the changes will be visible , there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities . in all the steps we take and recommendations we make , we will be making our facilities and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of security , while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day - to - day business .\\n primary responsibility for enron corp . security resides in our business controls organization . you can contact this organization through their website ( ) , by phone ( 713 - 345 - 2804 ) , or by email ( corporatesecurity @ enron . com ) . john brindle , senior director , business controls , leads this organization . please feel free to provide john and his team with your comments and questions , or to report security threats .\\n we have two areas to update you on : changes in the access procedures for the enron center campus in houston and changes to our travel advisory .\\n access to the enron center\\n over the next few days , the following access control procedures will be instituted at the enron center ( and other facilities where practical ) :\\n ? as employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the enron center , a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer .\\n ? employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid picture id to obtain access to the enron center ( u . s . driver \\' s license , u . s . or foreign passport , or some form of u . s . federal , state or local identification ) .\\n ? visitors to the enron center must produce a valid photo id when signing in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor card . adult visitors without a valid photo id ( u . s . driver \\' s license , u . s . or foreign passport , or some form of u . s . federal , state or local identification ) will not be allowed access to the enron center .\\n ? visitors to enron facilities must be escorted by an enron employee or badged contractor at all times .\\n ? visitors to the enron center will be met in the lobby by an enron employee or badged contractor , signed into a visitor \\' s log at the lobby reception area by the employee or badged contractor , and escorted to their appointment . at the conclusion of the appointment , the visitor will be escorted to the lobby by an employee or badged contractor , the visitor badge collected , and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the escorting employee or badged contractor .\\n ? employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their workplace by following these guidelines ; report suspicious activity to security ( phone 3 - 6300 ) , do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to you or hold doors open , allowing \" tail gating \" by others .\\n these will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instituted at enron . we ask that all employees be patient during congested times in the lobby . as we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equipment , we expect the inconvenience to decrease . we hope you understand these measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees .\\n travel advisory update\\n with the beginning of retaliatory strikes , we have two important recommendations :\\n ? while the retaliatory strikes are ongoing , corporate security recommends that travel through or to the middle east be avoided . we continue to strongly recommend that all travel during this time to afghanistan , yemen , pakistan , indonesia , iran , iraq , sudan , somalia , tajikistan , turkmenistan , georgia , and the kyrgyz republic be canceled . in addition , we recommend that planned travel to egypt , israel , gaza / west bank , jordan , lebanon , saudi arabia , syria , and algeria be very carefully considered .\\n ? for non - u . s . citizens traveling in the united states , corporate security recommends that you carry documentation . there have been several recent reports of non - u . s . citizens who reside in the united states being questioned and asked for documentation when boarding u . s . domestic flights . as a result , we suggest that all non - u . s . citizens who currently reside in the united states - and who do not have permanent resident alien status - carry their passport , form i - 94 and form i - 797 at all times . we would also suggest that permanent resident aliens carry their permanent resident ( green ) card as proof of their status as a precautionary measure . it appears that immigration officials may be applying a section of the immigration and nationality act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his / her \" registration \" documentation with them at all times . this can include a permanent resident card , form i - 94 card , employment authorization card , border crossing card , or a temporary resident card . immigration officials have not historically been asking domestic travelers for \" registration \" documentation , but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere , it would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your current lawful status .\\n we will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the corporate security website and by e - mail , as appropriate .',\n",

       " 'Subject: article on skilling \\' s speech at the aa energy conference\\n drive to succeed : enron prefers toyota to gm\\n to prosper in the new energy economy , enron coo jeffrey k . skilling says oil\\n and gas companies need to trash their traditional business models and instead\\n reshape themselves to resemble toyota when it captured the imagination and\\n pocketbook of u . s . consumers 30 years ago .\\n in a somewhat back - to - the - future treatise on how enron expects to continue\\n its monumental success , skilling told arthur andersen energy conference\\n attendees to define themselves not by their industry , but rather by their\\n skills base . toyota changed the u . s . auto industry by outsourcing its\\n production , offering customers exactly what they wanted cheaper and faster .\\n the energy industry has to do the same thing into the future , he told the\\n houston audience .\\n \" in 1982 , the energy industry was a very rigid industry , \" he said , pointing\\n to a similar business model that had been used by general motors and ford\\n motor co . those companies did every bit of the manufacturing process , keeping\\n all of its pieces within the corporate structure . then toyota turned things\\n upside down .\\n when a customer wanted a different radio , toyota relied on outside producers .\\n it didn \\' t stop the production line to please the customer . and it was able to\\n do it faster . enron has used the same model to shape its achievements ,\\n packaging components for customers to save time and money . other energy\\n companies are now adopting that method .\\n in many ways , skilling said enron views itself as the toyota of the energy\\n industry . \" we don \\' t feel we have to provide all components , but package them\\n the way the customer wants them . this is a pervasive trend we are seeing all\\n over the industry . \"\\n enron , which has had a shareholder return of 1 , 333 % in 10 years ( january 1990\\n to november 2000 ) , saw the changes required by new technology and\\n deregulation and redefined its core competencies , which grew from its\\n pipeline business . skilling said to remain successful , the houston - based\\n corporation plans to continue to morph .\\n \" it all hinges on one good idea enron had in the 1980 s , that vertically\\n integrated structures had dominated our industry and the structures were\\n starting to break up . in the energy industry , the reason was deregulation .\\n fundamentally , this is a better business structure for two reasons : you can\\n be supplied with cheaper cost components and it allows you to change much\\n more quickly . \"\\n instead of bigger energy companies , skilling said he expects to see many\\n smaller companies , \" maybe thousands tied together electronically and\\n vertically . \" the transformation and interaction costs are \" collapsing across\\n the economy . \" as an example of interaction costs , skilling used bank tellers .\\n in 1985 , it cost a bank $ 1 . 50 a transaction . to bank on the internet today ,\\n it costs a bank less than a penny .\\n this drop in interaction costs is a major reason enron finds the bandwidth\\n market so attractive . in 1995 , the length of time to provision bandwidth was\\n six to eight months . today , it \\' s two to three months . and next year , skilling\\n predicts it will take one second .\\n \" we will have bandwidth on demand by next year , \" he said , and added that\\n enron plans to be the leader in the field .\\n similarly , long - term gas contracts in 1982 took two to three years to\\n execute . in 1989 , they took nine months . three years ago , they took two weeks\\n to execute . today , using enrononline and other similar internet trading\\n systems , it takes less than one second .\\n \" all of the sudden the world has changed . we have the same manufacture cost ,\\n but interactive costs collapse . i think that because of this , we \\' ll see the\\n collapse and demise of integrated energy companies around the world , \"\\n skilling said .\\n to survive , skilling advised companies to \" virtually reintegrate \" what they\\n need . \" if you have an old vertically integrated mind set , it \\' s tough . give it\\n up . i know there are still power producers who are buying gas reserves . i\\n don \\' t get it . it makes no sense whatsoever . you can get it online at the\\n lowest cost . if your business strategy is dependent on this , it will be a\\n very hard row to hoe . \"\\n each stage of production will become increasingly competitive in the next 10\\n years , predicted the enron president . \" you \\' re not just competing against\\n three people in west texas , but thousands around the world . \"\\n opportunities exist , he said , for those companies that \" go with the flow and\\n find ways to compete . create low cost , dependable market interfaces . . . provide\\n packaged turnkey solutions for customers through complex structures ,\\n differentiation and customization . \"\\n the only threat is from the old way of doing business , he said . \" but there is\\n tremendous opportunity to do things for customer you \\' ve never been able to\\n do . \" he suggested a \" new \" energy model based on brainpower , networking ,\\n offering real options to customers , moving quickly and being entrepreneurial .\\n \" at enron , this has been the whole premise : to be able to change by\\n responding and reacting to the environment . by getting components together\\n and packaging them for the customer . \"',\n",

cut\\n north - flowing alternate gas at compressor station cut points from la plata\\n to meacham as necessary to mitigate high line pressures or overscheduling\\n through kemmerer ; take all necessary steps to ensure that gas deliveries\\n from receipt points south of the meacham compressor closely approximate\\n confirmed nominations ; entitle for undertakes or overtakes , as appropriate ;\\n and finally , if required , northwest will issue operational flow orders .\\n if net scheduled volumes north through northwest ' s kemmerer compressor do\\n not exceed physical capacity , northwest will have much greater flexibility\\n during the clay basin and transwestern shut - ins . northwest ' s customers can\\n help themselves and reduce the likelihood that kemmerer will overschedule by\\n securing adequate gas from canadian suppliers or by using their jackson\\n prairie storage during this work .\\n northwest will make every effort to reduce the impact on its customers of\\n the clay basin and transwestern shut - ins and will be monitoring the\\n situation closely . northwest will take every opportunity to relax system\\n restrictions in later cycles if north flow volumes moderate . northwest is\\n confident that if its customers respond prudently , the impact of the\\n transwestern and questar maintenance will be greatly reduced .\\n if you have any questions , please contact your marketing services\\n representative .\",\n",

       " 'Subject: update on ammonia shutdowns / terra chemical\\n high prices force chemicals to sell gas , futures\\n chemical companies , forced to shut in operations because of high natural gas\\n prices , are nevertheless making money - - - by selling gas futures contracts .\\n terra industries and mississippi chemical corp . became the latest companies\\n to announce cutbacks related to current natural gas costs .\\n iowa - based terra industries said it had sold off a portion of its december\\n natural gas purchases , and shutdown 50 % of its verdigis , ok , ammonia\\n facility . the company had previously reported that it would not operate its\\n bytheville , ar , and beaumont , tx , facilities during the month of december as\\n well .\\n in a similar maneuver , mississippi chemical corp . , a producer of nitrogen ,\\n phosphorus and potassium - based products in mississippi , louisiana and new\\n mexico , reported the sale of all of its natural gas futures contracts from\\n january forward , in order to take full advantage of the opportunity uncovered\\n by soaring natural gas prices . mississippi chemical said it expects to\\n realize a pre - tax gain of $ 16 million in its second fiscal quarter ending\\n dec . 31 from the recently sold contracts .\\n the problem lies in the fact that escalating natural gas costs are not being\\n mimicked by chemical prices . an overabundance on the market has kept chemical\\n prices relatively low , while gas prices , a feedstock for some chemicals ,\\n continue to climb . the difference in the latest shutdowns is that the\\n companies involved have openly announced they have sold their gas contracts\\n off because it is more profitable than manufacturing their products , said ron\\n phillips of the fertilizer institute .\\n duke energy \\' s ken nyiri , divisional director of strategic planning and\\n research , commented on mississippi chemical \\' s transactions , \" i guess they\\n probably made about a $ 4 / mmbtu margin on the gas , which is significantly more\\n than they could make on the ammonia ; in fact , they would have lost $ 30 / unit .\\n their ammonia was probably costing them about $ 205 / ton to make ( with gas\\n bought at $ 5 / mmbtu in november ) and the market today is at $ 205 so basically\\n they would break even on their ammonia production costs . by selling the gas\\n at around $ 9 / mmbtu they made $ 4 / mmbtu . it was just a question of do they\\n convert the gas to ammonia and make nothing on it , or do they sell the gas\\n and make $ 16 million . \"\\n michael l . bennett , executive vice president of terra , said , \" the natural gas\\n price increase since our december requirements were purchased for verdigris\\n permitted us to sell a portion of those purchases and generate higher gross\\n profits than could be realized from selling the products manufactured with\\n the natural gas . we will evaluate the economics of bringing verdigris back to\\n full production near the end of december when january \\' s natural gas purchase\\n commitments must be made . \"\\n terra estimates the idled facilities represent 40 % , 30 % , 77 % and 88 % of the\\n company \\' s north american ammonia , uan , urea and methanol manufacturing\\n capacity , respectively . the production of all four chemicals are heavily\\n dependent on natural gas . phillips said \" the latest data we had in october\\n was that of the companies that we survey , which is not the entire ammonia\\n market , but a good bit of it , we were looking at operating rates of 76 % . \"\\n currently , a total of 4 - 5 million tons / year of ammonia production capacity is\\n out of service out of about 20 - 21 million tons / year of production capacity .\\n \" clearly some of these folks have been selling their gas [ rather than\\n producing ammonia ] , \" said nyiri . \" it \\' s the prudent thing to do , i think , in\\n this marketplace . buy your ammonia if you can . at $ 9 gas , that costs you\\n $ 350 / ton to make the ammonia , which is $ 145 more than the current market is\\n willing to pay . \"\\n a spokeswoman for mississippi chemical said the company held on to its\\n december gas contracts , and has been operating at varied levels of capacity\\n throughout 2000 ( see daily gpi , june 30 ) . \" depending on what the gas prices\\n are , and what our product prices are around the january - february time frame ,\\n we will make decisions then on our operations rate [ capacity ] , \" said melinda\\n hood , a mississippi chemical spokeswoman .\\n charles o . dunn , ceo of mississippi chemical , said , \" we remain committed to\\n the nitrogen business and our customers , but we also have to take advantage\\n of opportunities to optimize cash flow during these challenging times . it is\\n our belief that the current unprecedented natural gas prices are unlikely to\\n be sustained during the intermediate term , \" stated dunn . \" as a result , we\\n felt it was in the company \\' s best interest to sell our futures positions to\\n lock in the substantial gain afforded by the recent increase in natural gas\\n prices . going forward , we will continue to determine operating levels for our\\n plants based on the relationship between natural gas prices , nitrogen product\\n prices and our customers \\' requirements , as we have been doing for some time . \"\\n international imports are also hurting u . s . producers . currently , there is a\\n surplus of ammonia in the international market , which is holding ammonia\\n prices down . u . s . fertilizer producers can \\' t compete with the international\\n market . gas prices are 46 cents / mmbtu in russia , 50 cents to $ 1 / mmbtu in\\n argentina and venezuela , and $ 1 / mmbtu in trinidad . the u . s . imports 5 . 5\\n million tons of ammonia each year . fertilizers represent 80 % of the demand\\n for ammonia in the united states .\\n terra industries said its facilities would resume production as soon as it\\n became economical again - - - whether from gas prices declining or nitrogen and\\n methanol prices rising , just as long as \" prices reach levels allowing\\n positive cash flows . \"\\n nyiri said he believes relief is in sight . he pointed out that the ammonia\\n market has been sitting around the $ 205 / ton level for the last several\\n months , but believes ammonia prices will have to increase entering the next\\n planting season . \" i \\' ve got my model peaking out around $ 250 / ton in april or\\n may and at that time i have gas costs coming down . \" at that point , the 1 - 2\\n bcf / d of demand from the fertilizer production industry should begin\\n returning to service .\\n - -',\n",

       " \"Subject: third quarter earnings results\\n today , we announced our third quarter earnings results , which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $ 0 . 43 . this marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year , which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines . in addition , we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $ 0 . 45 for the fourth quarter ( $ 1 . 80 for 2001 ) and $ 2 . 15 for 2002 .\\n we made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about enron ' s business strategy and performance , so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter .\\n over the past few months , we have met with analysts to discuss enron ' s performance . we received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units . in response to that feedback , we have provided results separately for several of our business units . for example , while we have provided volume figures for north america and europe , this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for enron americas and for europe and other commodities . in addition , information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for wholesale services . this quarter they are reported separately . finally , even though our broadband business is now part of enron wholesale services , we are continuing to report that business separately .\\n following are the highlights of our businesses :\\n wholesale services : total income before interest , minority interests and taxes ( ibit ) increased 28 % to $ 754 million in the third quarter . total wholesale physical volumes increased 65 % to 88 . 2 trillion british thermal units equivalent per day ( tbtue / d ) .\\n americas : ibit increased 31 % to $ 701 million . natural gas volumes increased 6 % to 26 . 7 tbtu / d , and power volumes increased 77 % to 290 million megawatt hours ( mwh ) .\\n europe and other commodity markets : ibit remained unchanged at $ 53 million as compared to last year . while physical gas and power volumes increased , low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat .\\n retail services : enron energy services reported ibit of $ 71 million , compared to $ 27 million a year ago . so far this year , ees has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95 , 000 deals with small business customers .\\n transportation and distribution :\\n natural gas pipelines : ibit increased slightly to $ 85 million in the third quarter .\\n portland general : we reported an ibit loss of $ ( 17 ) million this quarter compared to ibit of $ 74 million a year ago . this loss is due to power contracts pge entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter . last week , we announced an agreement to sell pge to northwest natural . this transaction is expected to close next year .\\n global assets : this segment includes elektro , dabhol , tgs , azurix and enron wind . third quarter ibit remained unchanged at $ 19 million compared to last year .\\n broadband services : ibit losses were $ ( 80 ) million in the current quarter compared to a $ ( 20 ) million loss last year . this quarter ' s results include significantly lower investment - related income and lower operating costs .\\n corporate and other : this segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions . this segment reported an ibit loss of $ ( 59 ) million compared to $ ( 106 ) million a year ago .\\n in addition , this quarter we announced one - time charges of $ 1 . 01 billion . over the past few quarters , we have conducted a thorough review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential of our core businesses . these charges include :\\n ? a $ 287 million write - down of azurix corp .\\n ? $ 183 million associated with the restructuring of broadband services . this includes severance costs , a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers , and a write - down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers .\\n ? $ 544 million related to losses from certain investments , primarily enron ' s interest in the new power company , broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement .\\n with our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things : 1 ) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses , 2 ) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses , and 3 ) we expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors . to read the full earnings press release , go to www . enron . com / corp / pressroom / releases .\",\n",

( 4 to 5 days ) we then requested that the roswell cdc ( ernie delossantos ) determine the availability of approximately 150 \" of x 42 356 wall 10 \" pipe , 12 ea . y 42 365 wall 90 \\' s , and 1 ea . y 42 365 wall 45 . ( all material is available at redman supply in farmington )\\n conclusion :\\n mr . dickenson called with the results this morning and informed us that we appear to be exceeding allowable stress levels . the stress levels calculated by dickinson were in excess of yield as follows : 1 . 09 % of smys at the connection between the recycle / surge line and the discharge header , and 1 . 01 % of smys at the elbow immediately outside the building wall on the 10 \" recycle line . his recommendation was that the piping be cut and re - welded to return the piping to a lower stress condition and that suitable pipe supports , not subject to subsidence , be provided .\\n conference calls with engineering ( spalding , eisenstein , rance , pebdani , minnoti ? ? ? ) were set up to review the data with mr . dickenson and it was decided to have greg mcilwain on location monday in conjunction with mike mccracken to initiate the necessary repairs . after much discussion with dickenson with regards to the modeling performed , engineering indicated that the system is operational and therefore we will remain loaded until early next week when repairs are made . the repairs will be isolated to the # 3 unit only so , the downtime is not expected to exceed 2 days ( 48 hours ) . however , furhter evaluation by mcilwain will confirm timelines .\\n if anyone has questions through the weekend prior to mondays call , i can be reached at 520 - 853 - 3253 .',\n",

these fields could add over 0 . 5 bcf\\n per day later in 2001\\n - the response of the shallow water to the strong\\n late 1999 turnaround in drilling activity\\n * other important capacity additions are occurring in\\n the deepwater gulf of mexico , with 0 . 5 bcf per day in\\n 2000 and 2001 , and onshore , led by the bossier sand play\\n in freestone county , texas , the barnett shale play in\\n wise county , texas , and the powder river basin coal seam\\n play .\\n * further increases in drilling are likely to slow . new\\n deep land rigs are under construction and shallow rigs\\n are being refurbished with cannibalized parts from older\\n rigs . producers are experiencing delays in obtaining\\n rigs as the supply of quality rigs depletes and drilling\\n companies struggle to round out drilling crews .\\n regional markets - wild winter in the west\\n extremely cold weather in the west has brought rockies\\n prices close to parity with henry hub prices and\\n triggered early season spikes at sumas in the north and\\n topock in the south . pipeline maintenance on el paso is\\n exacerbating the regional demand pressure and has\\n contributed to topock differentials of over $ 2 . 00 per\\n mmbtu . tight pricing relationships to the henry hub in\\n the san juan and rocky mountains should hold through\\n february , with significant widening in differentials as\\n heating loads decline .\\n winter has arrived in earnest across north america , but\\n the start - up of firm transportation service on alliance\\n is delayed once again , this time until december 1 .\\n nonetheless , flows on the pipeline are under way ; cera\\n estimates that flows during october averaged 450 mmcf\\n per day . during november that total should climb to 750\\n mmcf per day , despite the later published start date .\\n with or without alliance flows , a weather - driven rebound\\n in midwestern demand relative to november and december\\n last year should keep prices in chicago at a significant\\n premium to henry hub prices . in the northeast ,\\n differentials remain extremely strong and exposed to\\n spikes throughout the winter , despite greater flows into\\n the region from atlantic canada this year ( see table 3 ) .\\n cera \\' s outlook by region follows :\\n * rockies . very cold weather within the region has\\n brought rocky mountain prices near parity with henry hub\\n prices . a break in the cold or a cold snap in the east\\n will likely widen the differentials , but strong heating\\n demand in the region will keep differentials within\\n about $ 0 . 25 per mmbtu below the henry hub price . cera\\n expects a december average differential of $ 0 . 25 per\\n mmbtu ; however , this differential is expected to show\\n significant volatility based on regional weather . a warm\\n week in the rockies could still push differentials\\n toward $ 0 . 50 per mmbtu .\\n * san juan . san juan prices will continue to hold close\\n to rockies prices through the winter , with significant\\n pipeline capacity between the two regions . heating loads\\n in the rockies will determine the san juan to henry hub\\n differential , with extended cold weather in the rockies\\n pulling both prices close to the henry hub price . cera\\n expects the december differential in the san juan basin\\n to average $ 0 . 20 per mmbtu .\\n * permian and mid - continent . unlike prices within the\\n rest of the west , differentials between the henry hub\\n and the mid - continent and permian basins are likely to\\n trade within a relatively narrow range during the\\n winter , as supplies from those basins are pulled either\\n east or west , depending on regional weather . cera\\n expects a permian to henry hub differential of $ 0 . 11 per\\n mmbtu and a mid - continent differential of $ 0 . 08 per\\n mmbtu for december .\\n * chicago . alliance flows into the chicago market are\\n now running close to 750 mmcf per day . however , the\\n onset of the heating season has offset those increased\\n flows and pushed chicago differentials up to near $ 0 . 15\\n per mmbtu relative to the henry hub , despite delays in\\n the completion of the vector pipeline . cera expects the\\n strong pricing at chicago to continue , and december\\n differentials should average $ 0 . 25 per mmbtu .\\n * northeast markets . assuming normal weather , we expect\\n to see december basis for new york relative to henry hub\\n at $ 1 . 03 per mmbtu . new england will likely see prices\\n $ 0 . 05 - $ 0 . 15 higher , depending on the pipeline . much of\\n this increased basis differential is caused by fuel\\n costs . for example , with a 9 percent retention rate from\\n the gulf coast into new england , last december would\\n have seen retention costs of approximately $ 0 . 22 ; at\\n $ 5 . 70 , that same retention equates to $ 0 . 50 . despite\\n additional volumes of gas deliverable into the northeast\\n from the atlantic canadian fields , there have been no\\n additional regional pipeline facilities to deliver this\\n gas to the local markets , and an additional 166 , 000\\n mmbtu per day of potential demand will compete for the\\n capacity . because of this tightness , should this month \\' s\\n weather be colder than normal , we could see severe\\n spikes in basis similar to those seen in january 2000 .\\n these spikes could even exceed the highs seen in\\n january , depending on the severity of any cold snaps and\\n the extent to which new electric loads are realized .\\n canadian markets - winter begins\\n the colder - than - normal weather has increased demand in\\n western canada but is only now being felt in the east .\\n storage peaked in the west in early october at\\n approximately 225 bcf below last year \\' s level and 6 bcf\\n below the five - year average . even with modest\\n withdrawals since that time , storage inventories are\\n still estimated to be adequate to meet winter needs .\\n easter canadian storage has continued to grow , pushing\\n levels to over 245 bcf , 11 bcf above last year and well\\n above the five - year average . with the eastward movement\\n of the colder weather , withdrawals are likely to begin .\\n this higher level of eastern storage will be useful with\\n the expected reduction of flows on transcanada .\\n the good news resulting from the cold is a more normal\\n \" freeze - up , \" which bodes well for a longer winter\\n drilling season . gas well completions are expected to\\n reach 8 , 500 for 2000 and will likely be even higher next\\n year .\\n further delays for alliance ?\\n the \" commercial \" in - service date for alliance has been\\n delayed until december 1 , the result of a combination of\\n problems with clearing the line , delays in the\\n completion of the aux sable liquids extraction plant ,\\n the delay of vector , and a lack of supply . the pipeline\\n has been flowing gas , however , with volumes building up\\n since september . it is estimated that flows for november\\n will average 750 mmcf per day . transcanada has taken the\\n full brunt of the alliance flows so far , with northern\\n border and pgt remaining strong . december should see\\n alliance flows build to between 900 and 1 , 000 mmcf per\\n day , with modest reductions in flows on northern border\\n and pgt . storage withdrawals will likely keep\\n transcanada reductions close to 350 mmcf per day , year -\\n over - year , until vector begins service to eastern\\n canada .\\n high prices : strong pull west\\n the high demand in the pacific northwest has also\\n provided strength for aeco . the aeco - henry differential\\n has dropped to the high $ 0 . 30 s and low $ 0 . 40 s as a\\n result of this increased pull . for december , the\\n differential is expected to average $ 0 . 50 per mmbtu , for\\n a resulting aeco average of c $ 6 . 97 per gigajoule\\n ( us $ 5 . 10 per mmbtu ) .\\n * * end * *\\n follow url for pdf version of this message with associated tables .\\n cera \\' s autumn 2000 roundtable event dates and agendas are now available at\\n http : / / www . cera . com / event\\n account changes\\n to edit your personal account information , including your e - mail\\n address , etc . go to : http : / / eprofile . cera . com / cfm / edit / account . cfm\\n this electronic message and attachments , if any , contain information\\n from cambridge energy research associates , inc .

and - tumble fashion . i went to a town meeting monday night to meet with a number of our ex - colleagues . their disappointment , upset and anger is very understandable . i , along with the entire management team , have committed that we are going to try to do whatever we can to fashion a reasonable resolution to their various issues .\\n in order to make sure that those that are truly in need have something to fall back on , we asked the court later in the week and got the judge to approve an emergency $ 5 million fund . we are now going to fish around for an independent administrator to evaluate the needs and disperse those dollars to former employees . i wanted you to be aware of that . i really do appreciate and understand everybody ' s upset .\\n last friday , february 22 , we presented to the creditors ' committee a formal proposal on a retention and severance program . as can be expected , there was some push back from the committee - - there were issues about some of the data , there were requests for additional data and further clarification .\\n the creditors ' committee formed a subcommittee . we provided to them more data . jeff mcmahon and i met with them on wednesday , february 27 , and we met with them again on thursday , february 28 . we are scheduled to meet with them again on monday and tuesday to resolve all the open issues and to get the full support and endorsement of the creditors ' committee on this program .\\n i have indicated to the subcommittee that getting a plan in place is jeff ' s and my highest priority . it is not right or fair for anyone to be in a state of ongoing uncertainty about their future , their future compensation , and any financial safety net , so we are going to have to move on this at light speed . i told the creditors ' subcommittee and asked that they tell the full committee that we want to be in a position by the week of march 11 to motion this up to the court . i ' ll keep you posted on progress . i am comfortable that the committee wants to put in place the retention and severance program and now we are just working out the bugs . hopefully , by the time we have the employee meeting , we can walk through the composition of the program in detail .\\n the powers that be -

employees ' fund . i ' d like your input on that . i thought it was a great idea and very generous .\\n we are moving forward with plans for an employee meeting later this month . hopefully i ' ll be able to meet many of you there . i ' ve tried to get around to say hello here and there . and again , i would encourage you if you have any questions , concerns or issues just give me an email or a buzz . sometimes it takes a few days for me to get back to you , but i ' m making a very concerted effort to answer everybody ' s inquiries .\\n other than that i don ' t have a lot to report . we ' ll continue to hammer out with the committee the retention program . hopefully by next friday i ' ll be able to report very substantial progress in this area . i want to thank everybody for their efforts , all their hard work and their focus on moving things forward .\\n one other thing ?\\n we did have a bank meeting on thursday afternoon . we have described to the banks what we believe is a very reorganizable entity here . we ' ll be sharing more about that at the employee meeting . i told the bank group , and it was echoed by management , that we believe there is a reorganizable , viable entity in enron ' s future . i ' ll bring you all fully up to speed on that at the employee meeting .\\n anyway , as i was saying ?\\n thanks so much for all your hard work , your efforts , your dedication . i hope you have a great weekend . i ' ll chat with next week .\",\n",

       " 'Subject: western market crisis : gas joins power - cera alert\\n - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by lorna brennan / et the accident further limited pipeline capacity\\n into california for a two - week period . during that time ,\\n the market drew heavily on storage inventories and\\n further weakened storage positions . as hydroelectric\\n generation declined through the summer , the price\\n strength extended into northern california . malin , which\\n had been pricing near parity with the henry hub in the\\n summer , began trading at a $ 0 . 50 per mmbtu premium to\\n the henry hub in september . the summer and early fall\\n market set the stage for continued and more intense\\n spikes this winter . the following factors are now\\n driving this market :\\n * continuing surges in gas demand . gas demand levels\\n have remained high since early summer , driven by higher\\n overall demand for electricity and lower hydroelectric\\n output . demand levels for the third quarter in the us\\n west averaged 10 . 7 billion cubic feet ( bcf ) per day , up\\n from 8 . 7 bcf per day during the third quarter 1999 .\\n persistently strong gas - fired generation production\\n through the fall months diverted gas to power\\n production , frustrating efforts to fill storage . this\\n pressure will continue . the year - over - year demand\\n increases from the power sector will be compounded , as\\n evidenced in november , by swings upward in residential\\n and commercial heating demand of 800 million cubic feet\\n ( mmcf ) per day . overall , cera expects nearly 1 . 6 bcf per\\n day of increased demand in the west this winter , with\\n the critical california and pacific northwest regions\\n showing 1 . 2 bcf per day of increased demand . key power\\n sector drivers , including the strong economy , colder\\n weather , and lower hydroelectric generation , will\\n continue to push gas - fired generation .\\n * pipeline utilization nears capacity . strong western\\n demand for gas has pushed utilization rates on western\\n pipes to high levels . flows from british columbia into\\n the northwest pipeline have remained at high levels\\n since summer , while flows from the rockies on northwest\\n have remained at pipeline capacity . flows on pgt into\\n kingsgate have remained at or near capacity , although\\n approximately 300 mmcf per day of excess capacity exists\\n on pgt into california at malin . likewise , flows out of\\n the rockies on kern river pipeline have consistently\\n remained at capacity . the only slack pipeline capacity\\n remaining for west coast gas markets has been on\\n southwest pipes . during the past few months , these\\n pipelines have operated at their highest utilization\\n rates since the addition of capacity from canada early\\n last decade . the high utilization of western pipeline\\n capacity - reminiscent of power plant capacity constraints\\n that helped propel power prices to all time highs in the\\n west this summer - leaves very little slack capacity to\\n provide a relief valve for demand spikes . and that is\\n exactly what has driven prices during the past few weeks\\n ( see figure 1 ) . given the level of storage inventories\\n and expected gas demand , flows on the el paso and\\n transwestern pipelines will have to reach even higher\\n flow levels from december through march than they have\\n averaged through november .\\n * deteriorating storage position . at the start of\\n november california storage inventories held at 154 bcf ,\\n a full 32 bcf below the five - year average inventory\\n level . the strong in - state withdrawals during november\\n weakened that position to 128 bcf ; the deficit swelled\\n to 62 bcf . inventories in california have never fallen\\n below 60 bcf , so deliverability through the end of\\n winter is likely less than 700 mmcf per day . storage\\n inventories in california are so low that utilities \\'\\n ability to balance withdrawals from storage with\\n purchases from demand - sensitive price points is severely\\n limited . if the cold weather blast anticipated for mid -\\n december materializes , this effort at balance will be\\n even further compromised for the remainder of winter\\n ( see figure 2 ) .\\n * short - term contracting . a significant amount of\\n western gas is purchased or indexed to the spot market .\\n a shift from term contracts for both gas and pipeline\\n capacity to spot transactions - in many cases in response\\n to gas and power industry deregulation - has left the west\\n much more exposed to spot market volatility . in other\\n areas of the country , utilities have significant firm\\n pipeline capacity extending from supply regions to the\\n citygate and / or have forward purchased gas ( at previous\\n and lower prices ) for at least some portion of their\\n winter supplies . as a result , unlike in eastern markets ,\\n a much larger proportion of the supply portfolio of\\n california utilities will be exposed to the current\\n price spikes .\\n * no alternatives . a lack of fuel - switching capability\\n prevents a meaningful demand response to higher gas\\n prices . power prices continue to move in lockstep with\\n the increase in gas prices . not surprisingly , gas prices\\n pushed the cost of gas - fired generation beyond the\\n federal energy regulatory commission \\' s ( ferc \\' s ) proposed\\n price cap of $ 150 per megawatt - hour , setting the stage\\n for a reassessment of this price limit . a small and\\n declining portion of power generators are liquid fuel\\n capable . significantly , air emissions restrictions -\\n already plaguing power markets with much higher\\n emissions credit costs this year - will make any further\\n switching to liquid fuels in the crucial california\\n market highly unlikely this winter . a recent meeting of\\n the south coast air quality management district , which\\n has jurisdiction over the los angeles area , concluded\\n with no relief granted to generators running short of\\n emissions credits .\\n market forces unite for price spikes during november\\n the first cold weather - related demand spike demonstrated\\n the combined power of these forces and the vulnerability\\n of the western markets . a cold weather system in mid -\\n november brought temperatures averaging 47 percent\\n colder than normal - the temperatures actually averaged 14\\n percent colder than a normal january week - and provided\\n the additional demand boost that taxed the gas delivery\\n systems on the west coast . capacity constraints on\\n moving gas into california that appeared during the\\n summer extended north into the pacific northwest as\\n heating loads climbed . this core demand compounded the\\n effects of continued strong demand for gas for power\\n generation .\\n the high power demand was the result of the intersection\\n of the annual low point for hydroelectric generation and\\n a series of planned and unplanned nuclear and coal power\\n plant outages . gas demand in the us west during the last\\n two weeks of november was boosted to approximately 15 . 5\\n bcf per day , driven by heating demand increases of 2 . 8\\n bcf per day above normal levels and power plant outage -\\n related demand increases of 1 . 0 bcf per day .\\n these demand spikes caused buyers - already dependent on\\n the spot market - to bid citygate prices to record high\\n levels through the last two weeks of november and into\\n december . since demand outstripped supply , prices rose\\n dramatically at all western price points , and flows of\\n natural gas to western markets increased over high\\n summer levels . citygate prices surged beyond $ 40 . 00 per\\n mmbtu on daily spot markets and averaged nearly $ 15 . 00\\n per mmbtu for december bidweek at topock . daily spot gas\\n prices have reflected imbalance penalty prices in many\\n western market regions .\\n west coast to remain disconnected through the winter\\n although the week of november 13 could prove to be the\\n peak demand week in the west this winter , cera does not\\n expect any significant retreat in gas prices on the west\\n coast any time soon . storage inventories are so low that\\n the ability to beat back demand spikes with high storage\\n withdrawals is not an option for gas utilities .\\n generators , which already rely heavily on the spot\\n market for supplies , are faced with a bidding war for\\n scarce supplies . colder - than - normal weather would likely\\n keep west coast prices in the $ 20 . 00 - $ 40 . 00 per mmbtu\\n range . more normal weather would allow a slow decline\\n from current levels of over $ 20 . 00 per mmbtu down into\\n the $ 15 . 00 - $ 20 . 00 per mmbtu range . however , the storage\\n situation and underlying demand strength mean that any\\n return to a lower pricing range is unlikely until early\\n january .\\n this winter will prove a critical test for western gas\\n markets , and the end of the heating season will likely\\n provide the first opportunity for lower price levels in\\n the west coast market . as heating loads diminish\\n significantly in march and storage deliverability is no\\n longer a critical issue , premiums should retreat back\\n into the $ 1 . 00 - $ 2 . 00 per mmbtu range . as hydroelectric\\n generation begins to increase , the pressure could\\n subside even further , but storage injections during the\\n spring shoulder season will likely limit price declines\\n even during the spring .\\n the unique vulnerability of the pacific northwest\\n the west coast price pressure is not limited to\\n california . high demand in the pacific northwest ( and\\n more indirectly in california ) will keep upward pressure\\n on prices from sumas to stanfield . northwest pipeline\\n capacity from the rockies was already fully utilized at\\n the onset of the cold weather and even so can only\\n provide gas so far into the pacific northwest . the\\n combined california and pacific northwest demand pushed\\n stanfield up in spite of the limited volumes that are\\n bidirectional there . the only supply source for the load\\n centers in southern british columbia and even more so in\\n northern pacific northwest ( such as seattle ) are from\\n westcoast at sumas . the westcoast mainline from the\\n producing fields in northeast british columbia has also\\n been operating at capacity . the same bidding forces felt\\n in california have been evident at these western\\n canadian price points , pushing sumas prices into the\\n $ 20 s per mmbtu . these forces will persist , keeping sumas\\n at a premium to aeco over the winter - and in much closer\\n relationship to california prices .\\n customer response : another log on the backlash bonfire\\n with power plants and gas utilities paying the current\\n high spot prices , consumers \\' bills from vancouver to san\\n diego will ultimately reflect these high commodity\\n prices . the gas industry has been preparing for rate\\n shock this winter , warning regulators and customers\\n alike . however , the price spikes in the west and the\\n sustained premiums in western markets move beyond\\n alarming . capacity holders are reaping significant\\n rewards for their investments in capacity positions ,\\n resulting in a substantial transfer of wealth from\\n consumers to capacity holders . market power and market\\n gaming accusations that have hit the power markets will\\n find easy application in their gas market counterpart\\n ( no matter what their merits ) . some level of\\n investigation into the natural gas markets during or\\n following this challenging winter should be expected . as\\n has occurred in the power markets , this will now turn\\n attention to gas purchasing practices , particularly in\\n california . the likely outcome of this process will be a\\n shift away from the heavy reliance on spot purchases\\n toward a more flexible portfolio approach .\\n * * end * *\\n follow url for pdf version of this alert with associated graphics .\\n come shoot the rapids with us at ceraweek 2001 , \" shooting the rapids :\\n strategies and risks for the energy future \" in houston , february 12 -

competition is not to blame for\\n california ' s problems ; and basic economic principles of supply , demand , and\\n prices affect market outcomes .\\n section 2 of this paper briefly reviews the history of electricity\\n regulation and restructuring in california and the problems that occurred\\n beginning in may 2000 . section 3 , the heart of this paper , offers guidance\\n to other states on the key ingredients of a competitive electricity\\n industry . this section makes several points :\\n * maintain a favorable investment and regulatory climate for new\\n generation to ensure that enough generation capacity is online and planned\\n to meet growing loads .\\n * ensure that enough infrastructure ( transmission capacity and natural\\n gas pipeline capacity ) is in place and planned to meet growing loads ,\\n maintain reliability , connect new generators to the grid , support large\\n regional markets , and provide fuel to power plants .\\n * encourage retail customers to participate in dynamic - pricing and\\n voluntary - load - reduction programs ( i . e . , couple retail and wholesale\\n markets ) .\\n * create honest retail competition : avoid standard - offer rates with\\n artificial discounts and create conditions that encourage many companies to\\n offer retail services without favoring individual competitors .\\n * encourage electricity suppliers to manage and diversify their supply\\n and price risks .\\n * create efficient and integrated wholesale markets for energy ,\\n ancillary services , and transmission congestion .\\n * monitor and minimize horizontal market power ( generation ) and\\n vertical market power ( combined ownership and operation of generation and\\n transmission ) .\\n ultimately , competitive markets for electricity will lower costs and\\n prices , better align consumer prices with producer costs , improve producer\\n efficiency in both investment and operation , maintain or improve\\n reliability , and yield greater innovation in customer services and pricing\\n options .\\n but , this transition from one industry structure to another is\\n turning out to be long and complicated . it is complicated because\\n electricity is so important to our modern , high - tech society ; electricity is\\n our most flexible fuel , providing light , heat , motive power , and the energy\\n to operate all our electronic equipment . also , electricity truly is a\\n real - time product for which production and consumption must occur at the\\n same time .\\n although the problems that have occurred in california are\\n substantial and worrisome , regulators and legislators in other states should\\n focus on the long - term benefits of competitive electricity markets and\\n accept the possible short - term problems that may occur . they also need to\\n recognize that wholesale markets are regional in scope and extend far beyond\\n the boundaries of any single state . finally , competition in retail and\\n wholesale markets must be coordinated ; in particular , it is not possible to\\n have competitive wholesale markets unless at least some retail load faces\\n time varying prices .\\n if states restructure properly to create competitive markets for\\n wholesale energy and retail services , we should all benefit . consumers will\\n enjoy lower prices , they will have many more choices of energy services and\\n price - risk tradeoffs , reliability will be improved because most reliability\\n services will be obtained through markets instead of by engineering edict ,\\n and the financial risks associated with building and operating power plants\\n will be assigned properly to investors rather than consumers .\\n eric\\n eric hirst\\n consulting in electric - industry restructuring\\n 106 capital circle\\n oak ridge , tn 37830\\n * 865 - 482 - 5470 ( phone & fax ) * eric @ ehirst . com\\n http : / / www . ehirst . com\",\n",

the answer is you don \\x01 , t .\\n arguably , the cornhuskers , foxsports . com \\' s no . 1 team in its preseason top\\n 25 , were playing the best football in the country by the end of the 1999\\n season . in their last five games , the cornhuskers beat texas a & m , kansas\\n state , colorado , texas and tennessee by a cumulative score of 164 - 72 . the\\n scary thing about nebraska is that 10 offensive starters return for a team\\n that finished 12 - 1 last season .\\n the cornhuskers have an unquenchable desire to be the best again . it starts\\n in the off - season and continues through january . the running game took a\\n while to materialize last season because of injuries , but i - back dan\\n alexander and quarterback eric crouch have the ability to rush for 1 , 000\\n yards this season . even if the oft - injured alexander can \\x01 , t hold up to the\\n pounding , the cornhuskers have a replacement with great credentials and a\\n fitting name for this smashmouth football team : thunder collins .\\n nebraska will not only push other teams around . the cornhuskers will push\\n themselves . the school is touting guard russ hochstein and center dominic\\n raiola for the outland trophy , presented to the nation \\' s outstanding interior\\n lineman . the beneficiary of this internal competition is the offense .\\n \" this group has a great deal of confidence that always shows come august and\\n september , \" said nebraska coach frank solich , who has his best team since\\n taking over for tom osborne three years ago . \" we have a rich history and a\\n team coming off a good season that is not questioning things .\\n \" we have high expectations . some of it comes from how we finished last\\n season . a lot comes from playing in an excellent program and tradition . \"\\n the option and the \\' huskers are inextricably bound . it is their offense , and\\n they have been running it so long it is practically an open - book test for\\n defensive coordinators . yet , only eight teams have passed the test over the\\n last seven years . nebraska has won 81 games and three national titles in that\\n span .\\n \" we try to keep up with what \\x01 , s current and we use the spring to experiment , \"\\n solich said . \" but our players and coaches like to line up and beat you . our\\n players that are here love it . it is an aggressive style of play and that \\x01 , s\\n how they want to play it . it \\x01 , s what our players want to do on offense . \"\\n the cornhuskers will not go through the season unchallenged . crouch can put\\n his name up there with the turner gill , tommie frazier and scott frost for\\n the title of best nebraska quarterback ever , but all bets are off for this\\n team if crouch is hurt , because the cornhuskers lack depth at quarterback .\\n the schedule has its pitfalls too . notre dame , looking for a win that can\\n restore luster and a reason to keep coach bob davie , gets nebraska at home on\\n sept . 9 . a resurgent oklahoma team and top rival kansas state get nebraska at\\n their places . kansas state won the last time the teams met in manhattan .\\n the cornhuskers will probably play texas or oklahoma in the big 12\\n championship game , which has had a tendency to produce a surprise finish .\\n the cornhuskers also must shore up a secondary that loses ralph and mike\\n brown . but nebraska carlos polk back as the heart of the defense . polk is\\n heralded by nebraska insiders as the best linebacker in school history .\\n but come january 3 , nebraska will play florida state for the national title .\\n and the seminoles too will fall under the relentless attack .\\n senior writer darryl richards covers college football for foxsports . com . send\\n your comments to darryl richards .',\n",

muted 1999 peak . california alone should experience peak loads\\n that are approximately 3 , 600 mw higher than peak levels in june .\\n available generation capacity in the west has been at normal levels for this\\n time of year , although coal - fired plants are responding to a record\\n production year with repeated but short - lived outages . the steady decline in\\n hydroelectric generation will remove 3 , 900 amw from the west resource base\\n when compared with july levels and about 6 , 800 amw since june , although\\n reservoir refilling operations temporarily removed significant quantities of\\n hydroelectric generation during portions of june . given hydro operators '\\n economic interest in maximizing on - peak production at the expense of off - peak\\n production , the loss of capacity during the on - peak period will be lower than\\n these levels .\\n august will be a critical month for the heavily import - dependent state of\\n california . while the state will be drawing approximately 7 , 000 amw of\\n imports during august to meet demands during peak periods , cera expects the\\n level of imports to exceed 8 , 200 mw during peak demand conditions . the\\n southwest ' s need to supply native demand first will limit its ability to\\n export to california , and lower year -

fired generation at high levels . although less than 4 , 000 mw of gas - fired\\n generation is currently available in the region , it has been running at high\\n utilization rates .\\n high energy demand in california for pacific northwest energy will keep\\n differentials low between the regions . as in june , pacific northwest prices\\n will respond in kind to the volatility cera expects to occur in california in\\n august . in addition , if hot weather in the pacific northwest pressures\\n regional energy reserves , local prices will rise to keep energy in the\\n region , potentially causing prices in the pacific northwest to move higher\\n than those to the south .\\n california\\n california is entering the peak load season with relatively little generating\\n capacity down for maintenance . although hydroelectric output continues to\\n decline , statewide reservoir storage levels remain high at roughly 118\\n percent of normal . nevertheless , declining hydroelectric production is\\n expected to remove about 730 amw when compared with hydroelectric production\\n levels in june .\\n normal summer weather will push demand in the state up by about 3 , 600 amw\\n over june levels , which were high ( see table 3 ) . california ' s peak load is\\n expected to exceed 57 , 000 mw , compared with a peak load in june of\\n approximately 53 , 500 mw ( 43 , 447 mw on the state ' s iso system alone , according\\n to its own estimate ) . assuming normal plant outage rates , this demand level\\n will necessitate the import of about 8 , 200 mw of energy to meet the statewide\\n peak . even after curtailing the approximately 2 , 800 mw of interruptible load\\n available for tight supply situations , the state has a precarious 6 percent\\n capacity margin during the system peak . an extreme hot weather event could\\n push state loads up by an additional 3 , 000 mw . outages are likely if\\n additional imports are not available .\\n a capacity limit of 4 , 600 mw will be in place during the summer for energy\\n exports from the pacific northwest to northern california . the import limit\\n from the pacific northwest to southern california will be 3 , 100 mw .\\n rockies and southwest\\n august demand levels in the combined rockies / southwest region will increase\\n only slightly above levels in august 1999 , climbing approximately 275 amw , as\\n loads in the region - unlike the rest of the below - average wscc - were near\\n normal last august . even so , august loads will increase demand by over 1 , 250\\n amw when compared with levels in june of this year . as with last year and\\n this june , supplies in the region should be sufficient to meet peak demand\\n conditions under normal weather , although growing loads in the\\n rockies / southwest region have reduced its ability to supply neighboring\\n regions with energy during peak demand conditions .\\n high loads driven by hot weather will keep the region ' s prices high .\\n differentials between the region and california will be tight , but\\n california , having tighter supply - demand balances , will need to price at a\\n premium to attract energy . the high - capacity transmission ties between the\\n rockies / southwest and the california market , which is about 150 percent the\\n size of the rockies / southwest market , will ensure that prices in the\\n rockies / southwest stay close behind california prices whenever loads are high\\n in california .\\n regional gas market drivers\\n evidence of pipeline bottlenecks has emerged across the west , and supply and\\n demand forces over the next year look likely to intensify these pressures .\\n since the northern border expansion in late 1998 , narrow north - south and\\n east - west differentials across pricing points defined the market . this\\n summer , the continuing supply growth in the rocky mountains has widened\\n differentials between the rockies and the rest of the west . at topock ,\\n increasing gas demand in california and high utilization rates have resulted\\n in high premiums .\\n overall in north american gas markets , strong storage injection rates in\\n recent weeks have allowed some easing in prices - from an early july henry hub\\n price of $ 4 . 50 per mmbtu to under $ 4 . 00 per mmbtu . however , despite these\\n high injection rates , the supply - demand balance and absolute level of storage\\n inventories remain precarious . summer is not over and higher nationwide power\\n loads in weeks to come will likely cut into storage injections and boost\\n prices . the ongoing competition between power and storage for supply should\\n support an average henry hub price of $ 4 . 20 per mmbtu in august .\\n through the end of the summer , differentials in the west should hold near\\n current levels . the pressure of growing rocky mountain supply will continue\\n until heating loads start climbing in the fall . in california high seasonal\\n power loads should continue through august with hot weather and continued\\n declines in hydroelectric generation . demand strength is expected to\\n continue . across the west , august demand for gas should climb from 9 . 8\\n billion cubic feet ( bcf ) per day in june to 10 . 4 bcf per day , buoyed by an\\n increase in gas demand for power generation ( see table 4 ) .\\n california\\n high gas demand for power generation within california will continue through\\n august . cera expects an increase from the state ' s june demand levels of 5 . 6\\n bcf per day to 6 . 2 bcf per day during august . the increase stems from\\n declines in hydroelectric generation and increases in overall power loads .\\n total demand is expected to exceed last year ' s demand level by 1 . 2 bcf per\\n day . this will increase flows on pipelines into california , reduce the\\n state ' s storage surplus , and sustain high prices . cera expects pipeline\\n utilization rates during august to average 95 percent ( see table 5 ) . cera\\n expects an august topock - henry hub differential of $ 0 . 45 per mmbtu ( see table\\n 6 ) .\\n pacific northwest\\n despite the extremely high prices at topock and high demand in california ,\\n until recently gas at malin priced at a slight discount to henry hub prices .\\n after averaging $ 0 . 17 per mmbtu below the henry hub during the third quarter\\n last year , the differential so far during the third quarter this year is\\n $ 0 . 15 per mmbtu below the hub . this week malin is pricing at a $ 0 . 25 per\\n mmbtu premium relative to the henry hub . the topock - malin differential has\\n swelled to over $ 0 . 60 per mmbtu , signaling intra - california pipeline capacity\\n constraints . two factors pressured malin differentials during the early\\n summer .\\n * pressure on rocky mountain and aeco differentials . prices in the two areas\\n supplying the pacific northwest are under some pressure . increasing supplies\\n in the rockies are beginning to reach the limits of export capacity and put\\n downward pressure on rockies prices by limiting external market access . at\\n aeco , although export capacity out of the province is available , almost all\\n of that excess capacity accesses eastern canada on transcanada pipeline .\\n pipelines into the united states are running near capacity . because of\\n transcanada ' s limited ability to discount interruptible transport , the\\n available space is more expensive and therefore the last to be filled .\\n * low early summer regional demand . gas demand in the pacific northwest is\\n limited during late spring and early summer by declines in heating loads and\\n very strong hydroelectric output . even in a normal or dry hydroelectric year ,\\n seasonal runoff holds down gas demand for power generation in may and june\\n even as gas demand for power generation begins climbing in california .\\n increasing power loads are already evident .\\n the first factor will likely endure until heating season begins in late fall\\n and regional demand in the rockies and western canada begins climbing .\\n however , gas demand for power generation in the pacific northwest has\\n increased already this summer and will continue to climb through the end of\\n july and into august as hydroelectric generation wanes . this added demand - 200\\n million cubic feet ( mmcf ) per day above june demand levels - will provide some\\n support for malin prices and limited support for rockies and aeco prices .\\n malin - henry hub differentials are expected to average $ 0 . 05 per mmbtu above\\n the henry hub price during august .\\n rocky mountains\\n pressure on regional supplies within the rockies continues as exports out of\\n the region reach new highs . differentials to the henry hub have widened to\\n over $ 0 . 70 per mmbtu and although prices in the rest of the west will gain\\n some support from high power loads , regional demand in the rockies is\\n expected to remain near low seasonal levels through august . august demand is\\n expected to average 1 . 2 bcf per day in the region , approximately equal to\\n june ' s 1 . 1 bcf per day total demand . demand begins to build during september ,\\n but until the heating season begins in october , rocky mountain prices will\\n lag well below prices in the rest of the west . cera expects a rocky\\n mountain - henry hub differential of $ 0 . 60 per mmbtu during august .\\n although some narrowing in rocky mountain differentials looks likely as\\n seasonal demand increases through the fall , the rapid build in supply in the\\n region will likely keep differentials wide during 2001 . cera expects a supply\\n build this year of nearly 300 mmcf per day , followed by a build of over 350\\n mmcf per day during 2001 . currently , approximately 300 mmcf per day of excess\\n pipeline export exists out of the region , with the largest increment on\\n transcolorado into the san juan basin . next summer , all capacity will likely\\n run close to full . until export pipelines expand - the first likely expansion\\n is trailblazer - differentials will remain wide . for 2001 , cera expects an\\n average annual differential below the henry hub of $ 0 . 65 per mmbtu .\\n southwest\\n differentials in the san juan and permian basins have gained considerable\\n strength relative to henry hub prices amid the recent hot weather in texas .\\n permian supplies are pricing at a slight premium to the henry hub price , and\\n in the san juan basin prices have narrowed from an early july differential of\\n $ 0 . 35 per mmbtu to a differential of less than $ 0 . 20 per mmbtu . cera expects\\n demand in the southwest during august of 1 . 4 bcf per day , an increase from\\n june ' s level of 1 . 3 bcf per day , but the larger texas market will determine\\n the relative strength of differentials in those two basins . cera expects a\\n san juan differential of $ 0 . 30 per mmbtu during august , with a permian basin\\n differential of $ 0 . 06 per mmbtu .\\n differentials between the rocky mountains and the san juan basin have widened\\n substantially over the past two months with supply increases in the rocky\\n mountains . flows on transcolorado increased from a monthly average of under\\n 20 mmcf per day to over 100 mmcf per day during june . supply in the two\\n regions is following opposite paths ; rockies supply is climbing rapidly , and\\n san juan supply has likely peaked and should decline slowly beginning this\\n year . cera expects a decline in supply of 30 mmcf per day during 2000\\n relative to 1999 and an additional decline of 150 mmcf per day during 2001 .\\n because of these different outlooks , wider rockies - san juan differentials\\n will persist .\\n * * end * *\\n follow url for pdf version of this monthly briefing with associated tables .\\n note : should the above url not work , please use the following :\\n account changes\\n to edit your personal account information , including your e -

       " 'Subject: safety bulletin\\n the team concept has given us numerous opportunities for improvements over the past several years with team members continuing to be recognized and rewarded for their positive efforts and accomplishments . as accomplishments are made , trust and responsibilities increase , and the team experiences growth , maturity , and the associated rewards .\\n a part of this growth and maturity must include the realization and acceptance of the teams responsibility to monitor and enforce company policies and procedures . as you heard from me in 2000 , i will protect those who are complying with and enforcing our requirements , but i have zero tolerance for those who choose not to do so . along with the rewards for positive efforts , there are also consequences for those who fail to act when circumstances call for action .\\n during the year 2000 , several ets employees received disciplinary action as a result of their failure to act and / or ignoring safe work practices . these cases were distributed to all employees in the form of a safety bulletin . it has been my intention that we all learn from these instances to make our work place even safer .\\n as we publish this first , and hopefully only , safety bulletin in 2001 , i would like to share with you two instances from last year .\\n after repeatedly counseling a fellow team member observed violating several safety requirements ( including hard hat , safety glasses , frc ) , one team took action , which ultimately resulted in this person being discharged . while this may seem to be a harsh outcome , it is much better than the person injuring themselves , or even worse , a fellow team member . this person had others expressing concern over his well - being and chose to ignore the warnings . individual team members acted on their responsibility and the team as a whole accepted their accountability .\\n in the second case , a team member chose to drive a company vehicle without using a seatbelt . the employee was involved in an accident ejecting him from the vehicle , causing injuries that could have been prevented if the seat belt would have been properly used . this employee is lucky to be alive . use of seat belts by all occupants of company vehicles is one of the most basic elements of our program and has been a requirement for over 20 years . as the use of seat belts is habit forming , could this have been the first time the employee failed to use them ? is it possible that other team members had observed this failure in the past and not acted ? could this have been prevented through positive interaction ? had positive interaction been taken but ignored ?\\n when the declaration of interdependence was introduced in 1998 , we made the commitment to each other that we would be our brothers and sisters keeper and to remind each other of the need to comply with safety requirements at all times . while some employees may feel uncomfortable enforcing our requirements , that does not relieve the person from their responsibility . likewise , a team is responsible and accountable for the actions ( or lack of a required action ) of each team member . each individual team member and the team as a whole are responsible for the outcome and any disciplinary action that management may be required to take .\\n please assist us in creating the safest work environment possible . our most important personal goal should be to do whatever it takes to arrive home safely each and every night , and should expect nothing less from peers or members of your leadership to hold you accountable for doing just that .',\n",

mail category : alert\\n product line : latin american energy\\n url :\\n summary :\\n the opening of brazil ' s upstream oil sector has taken another step forward\\n this week following the successful anp auction of 21 blocks . this bidding\\n round comes one year after anp ' s first round , held in june 1999 . the bid was\\n well subscribed by 44 companies that were qualified to participate and bid\\n for the 10 onshore and 13 offshore blocks throughout nine basins in brazil .\\n although the anp collected lower participation fees than in the first round\\n ( us $ 9 . 0 million compared with us $ 9 . 8 million in the first round ) , the second\\n round was generally considered a success .\\n cera alert : 06 / 16 / 2000\\n title : brazilian power markets : demand recovery gathers steam but supply\\n questions remain\\n author : bailey , mattos\\n e - mail category : alert\\n product line : latin american energy\\n url :\\n summary :\\n brazil ' s power demand grew rapidly throughout the first quarter of 2000 .\\n february demand was 6 . 8 percent over february 1999 levels , and march demand\\n grew a further 7 . 6 percent above the previous year . the industrial sector\\n continued to lead the recovery with year - to - date demand growing 9 . 8 percent\\n over 1999 , and commercial sector demand growth remained strong at 7 . 5 percent\\n over a similar period . as demand growth strengthened , hydro power generation\\n increased while thermal generation levels declined steadily from a peak in\\n january . hydro stored energy levels had begun to decline in all regions by\\n the end of april , signaling the end of the wet season . with rapidly\\n increasing demand , particularly in the south and southeast regions , brazil\\n could experience power shortages during the coming dry season if capacity\\n additions that are currently scheduled to come online in the next several\\n months are delayed .\\n cera decision brief : 06 / 20 / 2000\\n title : mexico after the elections : the real battle begins\\n author : puyana\\n e -

- and\\n pastrana ' s remaining term in office - - is running out .\\n cera alert : 06 / 30 / 2000\\n title : argentine power markets : winter constraints push prices higher in may\\n author : bailey\\n e - mail category : alert\\n product line : latin american energy\\n url :\\n summary :\\n prices in the argentine power market were significantly higher in may owing\\n to the combination of continued low hydro output , strong demand growth , and\\n periodic constraints on natural gas deliveries to power plants in the buenos\\n aires region . spot power prices ( energy component only ) averaged $ 18 . 24 per\\n megawatt - hour ( mwh ) in may . although average power prices declined from last\\n year , price volatility increased , with several short - duration episodes of\\n prices over $ 60 per mwh as gas unavailability in the buenos aires region\\n forced several midcost units offline during peak hours . in june , prices are\\n expected to continue strengthening to the $ 24 - $ 28 per mwh range on average .\\n beyond june , price pressures are expected to remain negative as increasing\\n hydro output , new and returning low - cost thermal capacity , and the end of gas\\n constraints push average prices back toward $ 15 per mwh or below by august or\\n september .\\n cera alert : 06 / 01 / 2000\\n title : us gas markets reach new heights : where will it stop ?\\n author : n . american gas team\\n e - mail category : alert\\n product line : north american gas\\n url :\\n summary :\\n the us gas market enters the month of june with prices at the highest level\\n since deregulation . at the henry hub prices have surged to as high as $ 4 . 50\\n per mmbtu - - up from less than $ 3 . 00 per mmbtu during april . behind this has\\n been a building and serious shortfall of supply , the result of disappointing\\n gas production levels and surging gas demand for power generation . the gap\\n between these two forces has been met through storage inventories , with\\n injections so far this spring running between 1 . 5 and 2 . 0 bcf per day below\\n last year ' s rate . the continued tension between these two forces will keep\\n the pressure on prices this summer , and the need to inject gas into storage\\n will price out increments of demand .\\n cera alert : 06 / 15 / 2000\\n title : monthly briefing - - the pressure cooker\\n author : n . american natural gas team\\n e - mail category : alert\\n product line : north american gas\\n url :\\n summary :\\n pressure remains extremely strong in the united states gas market as three\\n factors - - the increasing power generation demand , lower storage inventories ,\\n and us wellhead supply still struggling to rebound - - call into question the\\n ability to build storage to a level adequate for next winter . prices are\\n being supported also by concurrent strength in oil and liquids markets ,\\n making traditional alternatives to gas much more expensive than in recent\\n years . in this environment intense competition between power generation\\n demand and storage injections will continue throughout the summer - - with\\n pressure increasing into july as temperatures rise - - with the result that gas\\n will continue to price at the high levels necessary to discourage end - use\\n demand . cera expects a july average price of $ 4 . 45 per mmbtu .\\n cera decision brief : 06 / 15 / 2000\\n title : western canada supply growth : getting nowhere faster\\n author : eynon , small\\n e - mail category : decision brief\\n product line : north american gas\\n url :\\n summary :\\n as us supply declines and demand grows , current high gas prices are\\n reinforced , but western canadian gas supply growth appears to be faltering\\n when it is needed most . both transitory factors and enduring trends underlie\\n the disappointing production growth results . the largely weather - related\\n transitory factors have had a near - term impact on drilling and connection\\n activity . the underlying trends have been developing slowly over time . more\\n shallow gas wells have been drilled in the past three to four years and\\n created a shift to higher average basin declines and lower average per well\\n production rates . thus more shallow wells are needed just to replace\\n production . with a shift to more exploration and deeper drilling , higher\\n supply growth rates are possible , but if that does not occur , other potential\\n supply sources may step in . significant arctic reserves in the mckenzie delta\\n and the alaskan north slope are once again entering the spotlight . coal bed\\n methane has become a str !\\n ong source of us supply . although now ignored in canada , it may become a\\n future source of canadian gas .\\n cera watch : 06 / 20 / 2000\\n title : reaching new heights\\n author : n . american natural gas team\\n e - mail category : watch\\n product line : north american gas\\n url :\\n summary :\\n fundamentals have taken center stage , as building demand pressure accompanies\\n us supply declines . storage inventories have been significantly reduced , and\\n the pressure for storage injections is likely to intensify as we head into\\n the summer months . demand - driven growth continues , as completions of\\n gas - fired power generation plants accelerate to a pace above 10 , 000 megawatts\\n per year and economic growth stimulates electricity demand . the result is a\\n higher - price playing field for natural gas , with the average henry hub price\\n likely to reach $ 3 . 67 per mmbtu for 2000 - - its highest level since the\\n development of spot markets .\\n cera private report : 06 / 21 / 2000\\n title : closing the utility stock valuation gap : does strategy matter ?\\n author : parshley\\n e - mail category : private report\\n product line : north american power\\n url :\\n summary :\\n the stock market has been delivering an unsettling message to the utility\\n industry . traditionally undervalued in the market , the sector is trading at a\\n historically wide 50 percent discount to standard and poor ' s s & p 500 . the s & p\\n utility index over the past 18 months gained only 5 percent , with huge gains\\n by some energy companies offset by a 15 percent drop in stock price for 29\\n electric utilities . yet early this year , the spu outpaced all other industry\\n groups . how should constantly evolving utilities in this wide - open sector\\n form a strategic plan to maximize shareholder value while achieving success ?\\n the value of electric utility merger and acquisition deals for 1999 - - a record\\n $ 50 billion - - was double the 1998 value . but are these choices ahead of the\\n curve ? and when will the market catch up ? three groups of new companies with\\n distinctive strategies may provide clues to the new strategic landscape :\\n multiservice and technology providers , superregionals , and global power and !\\n energy companies . three other strategic choices are considered in evaluating\\n responses to these challenges .\\n cera decision brief : 06 / 23 / 2000\\n title : the summer 2000 spot electricity markets outlook : divergent trends in\\n price volatility\\n author : makovich , sannicandro\\n e - mail category : decision brief\\n product line : north american power\\n url :\\n summary :\\n while several regional power markets are likely to see a repeat of price\\n spikes this summer , other markets are likely to see a reversal in price\\n volatility as supply - demand balances improve dramatically . one way to\\n interpret forward markets is as a consensus of market expectations .\\n therefore , forward prices for on - peak wholesale power reflect the common\\n expectation that prices will spike as high as - - or even higher than - - in 1999 .\\n a significant disconnect exists between the forward market prices and market\\n fundamentals for the upcoming summer in some regional markets .\\n cera alert : 06 / 02 / 2000\\n title : atlantic basin gasoline markets soar\\n author : meyers\\n e - mail category : alert\\n product line : refined products\\n url :\\n summary :\\n spurred by supply concerns at the start of the summer driving season , spot\\n gasoline - to - crude oil price differentials on both sides of the north atlantic\\n have soared to the highest levels seen since the gulf war . in cera ' s view ,\\n this strength in margins is attributable to the convergence of three factors :\\n very low inventories , tightening gasoline specifications , and legal\\n uncertainty .\\n cera alert : 06 / 13 / 2000\\n title : refined products line - - us markets\\n author : refined products team\\n e - mail category : alert\\n product line : refined products\\n url :\\n summary :\\n the us gasoline market exhibited exceptional strength during may . us gulf\\n coast unleaded gasoline surged to $ 8 . 40 per barrel measured against wti , up\\n $ 3 . 58 per barrel over the strong april value of $ 4 . 82 . apparent demand for\\n gasoline skyrocketed to 8 . 64 million barrels per day ( mbd ) in response to the\\n start of the summer driving season . despite increases in the reported demand\\n for distillate and jet / kerosene , these markets did not experience the same\\n month - over - month strength in differentials , dropping to $ 1 . 58 and $ 2 . 58 per\\n barrel versus wti , respectively .\\n cera alert : 06 / 20 / 2000\\n title : refined products line - - european markets\\n author : refined products team\\n e - mail category : alert\\n product line : refined products\\n url :\\n summary :\\n as higher crude oil prices started to reduce the high product differentials\\n to brent and thus lower refinery margins , refiners attempted to prevent this\\n situation from worsening by reducing throughputs . however , very tight markets\\n for gasoline and to a lesser extent for automotive diesel helped to limit the\\n fall in those products ' values . meanwhile , fuel oil discounts to crude oil\\n widened in may , driving down simple / hydroskimming margins .\\n in recent weeks , the combination of lower primary products inventories and\\n reductions in operations at some refineries has helped differentials to\\n recover . this has pushed margins to above may ' s averages , although still\\n below april ' s peaks .\\n cera alert : 06 / 26 / 2000\\n title : recent actions signal progress toward mtbe elimination\\n author : stackpole\\n e - mail category : alert\\n product line : refined products\\n url :\\n summary :\\n the close scrutiny that federal reformulated gasoline ( rfg ) now faces from\\n the media and public officials owing to midwestern market price spikes has\\n not stopped the inexorable political progress toward eliminating methyl\\n tertiary butyl ether ( mtbe ) use in the us gasoline pool . additional\\n signposts , including heightened congressional debate over legislation\\n eliminating mtbe use and state actions to ban mtbe , continue to emerge that\\n point the way toward mtbe - free gasoline in the united states .\\n cera alert : 06 / 29 / 2000\\n title : refined products : market update\\n author : refined products team\\n e - mail category : alert\\n product line : refined products\\n url :\\n summary :\\n refined products markets continue to display marked regional differences . in\\n the atlantic basin , low gasoline inventories in both the united states and\\n europe , which resulted from many months of opec production restraint ,\\n continue to dominate the market , and gasoline differentials above crude are\\n at their highest level in over ten years . although signs are emerging of a\\n possible correction in the north american market in the coming month , the\\n 2000 gasoline season will almost certainly be the strongest experienced by\\n atlantic basin refiners in many years . in contrast , asia pacific spot\\n refining margins were weak through most of june , until the recent accident at\\n kpc ' s mina al - ahmadhi refinery prompted a quick strengthening in prompt\\n singapore margins . however , with ample unused refining capacity available\\n east of suez and the likelihood of a partial restart of the kpc refinery in\\n july , cera ' s outlook is for that strength to be of short duration .\\n cera alert : 06 / 23 / 2000\\n title : new peaks , new prices\\n author : zenker , moritzburke , snyder\\n e - mail category : alert\\n product line : western energy\\n url :\\n summary :\\n in the west , july typically marks the start of the summer cooling season and\\n steadily rising power prices . cera expect the west to be the only region in\\n north america with a year - over - year increase in peak electricity demand .\\n power prices already established new record highs in june , suggesting that as\\n demand reaches its peak in the coming months western power markets will\\n continue to experience increased volatility compared with last year ' s levels .\\n the convergence of higher gas prices , growing power demand , and reduced\\n hydroelectric energy production compared with 1999 levels is pushing up\\n western power prices . greater utilization of gas - fired generators within the\\n west has supported western differentials and contributed to high gas prices\\n throughout north america . western gas prices should continue to be strong ,\\n boosted by continuing increases in regional gas demand for power generation\\n and pressure across north america to inject gas into storage in anticipation\\n of summer !\\n power loads .\\n cera alert : 06 / 15 / 2000\\n title : oil market turmoil : opec seeks a short - term fix\\n author : world oil team\\n e - mail category : alert\\n product line : world oil\\n url :\\n summary :\\n driven by strong demand - - especially in the recovering asian economies and the\\n united states - - oil prices ( both wti and brent ) have again broken the $ 30\\n level - - a mark that is of particular significance in this us election year . in\\n turn , the oil market ' s attention is again fixed on opec , as it prepares for\\n its june 21 meeting , but its members are deeply divided over how to respond .\\n cera alert : 06 / 16 / 2000\\n title : the state of the oil market : market supported , psychology enhanced ,\\n and opec driven\\n author : world oil team\\n e - mail category : alert\\n product line : world oil\\n url :\\n summary :\\n the key ingredient in the volatile oil market is the new opec - - and its\\n successful implementation of a strategy to keep supply one half step behind\\n demand - driving inventories down for crude , with the side effect of lowering\\n stocks for several products in markets such as the united states and europe .\\n three features of the current oil market are supporting prices :\\n * market supported\\n * psychology enhanced\\n * opec driven\\n cera alert : 06 / 22 / 2000\\n title : opec ' s cautious new agreement\\n author : world oil team\\n e - mail category : alert\\n product line : world oil\\n url :\\n summary :\\n opec ' s agreement to raise its production quota beginning july 1 by 708 , 000\\n barrels per day to 25 . 4 million barrels per day is consistent with its\\n strategy of restraining supply to maintain oil inventories at relatively low\\n levels . the gain in supply is a short - term fix meant to alleviate political\\n pressure for increased production and to push prices below $ 30 but keep them\\n in a mid - to upper $ 20 s range .\\n * * end * *\\n follow url for html version of this message only .\\n note : should the above url not work , please use the following :\\n account changes\\n to edit your personal account information , including your e -

and its indirect stake in\\n hanover compressor , which manufactures equipment used to\\n increase the pressure of natural gas and facilitate its\\n flow on interstate pipelines .\\n yesterday , investors anxiously awaited a report by moody \\' s\\n investors service , which like other major credit - rating\\n firms , currently ranks enron \\' s debt at the lowest\\n investment - grade level . if enron were to lose its\\n investment - grade status , it could be forced to repay or\\n refinance up to $ 3 . 9 billion in debt , while other traders\\n would probably further curtail business . but by late\\n yesterday , moody \\' s ( news / quote ) decided not to issue a\\n statement after receiving assurances from enron and dynegy\\n officials that a renegotiated deal would be announced soon ,\\n the executives said . a moody \\' s spokesman declined comment .\\n executives close to the talks said that they hoped that\\n new cash from dynegy would reassure both wall street and\\n the energy - trading markets that enron \\' s trading floor would\\n survive and remain a valuable asset .\\n but analysts and investors are having difficulty figuring\\n how much value the trading operation has already lost , and\\n how much the business has been reduced because of credit\\n concerns .\\n \" i believe dynegy is probably seeing that deterioration in\\n the core business and wants to renegotiate the purchase\\n price as a result , \" said andre meade , head of united states\\n utilities research for commerzbank securities in new york .\\n \" i don \\' t think anyone can estimate the earning power of\\n enron over the next three to four quarters , and i \\' m not\\n sure enron has a good estimate . \"\\n mr . meade said he did not believe that dynegy \\' s earlier\\n estimate that the acquisition would add 90 cents a share to\\n its earnings was \" reliable today , given how sharply the\\n business seems to have deteriorated . \" by mr . meade \\' s\\n calculations , if enron \\' s trading volumes were to fall 50\\n percent next year - even if normal volume growth levels\\n returned in 2003 - that would wipe out nearly all the value\\n in the stock .\\n karen denne , an enron spokeswoman , said the company had\\n experienced a decline in energy trading volume and in the\\n number of traders doing business with it , but both\\n stabilized yesterday . she declined to elaborate or quantify\\n the decline .\\n she also said that enron \\' s trading operation remained\\n profitable , though she could not quantify it , and she also\\n said she did not know whether the company was working on a\\n possible bankruptcy filing or other contingency plans\\n should its business and liquidity worsen . \" we \\' re moving\\n forward with the merger , \" she said .\\n dynegy officials did not return telephone calls yesterday .\\n shares of enron rose yesterday on news of a possible\\n revised acquisition agreement . they closed at $ 4 . 11 , up 2 . 5\\n percent , or 10 cents . shares of dynegy closed at $ 40 . 89 , up\\n 4 . 2 percent , or $ 1 . 64 .\\n though yesterday \\' s gains halted a four - day slide in enron\\n shares , the stock is down 95 percent this year after\\n disclosures of major losses as well as significant\\n accounting errors that led enron to admit it overstated\\n profits during the last five years by nearly $ 600 million .\\n now , difficulties within enron \\' s trading operation are\\n exacerbating the company \\' s overall liquidity problems in\\n three ways , according to some analysts and rival\\n energy - trading executives .\\n first , other traders are requiring enron to put up greater\\n margin on its trades . on top of that , in some cases enron \\' s\\n traders are being forced to pay more to buy natural gas\\n than traders at other companies . this credit premium in\\n some transactions has ranged from 3 cents to 6 cents for\\n every million british thermal units of gas enron buys ,\\n these people say .\\n additionally , many traders , like the mirant corporation\\n ( news / quote ) , have either scaled back or stopped doing\\n business with enron , hurting its trading revenue .\\n mr . meade of commerzbank said \" end - use customers and\\n trading counterparties appear to be shifting their business\\n to competitors as a result of enron \\' s credit concerns and\\n are reluctant to increase their exposures to enron . \"\\n how to advertise\\n - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\\n for information on advertising in e - mail newsletters\\n or other creative advertising opportunities with the\\n new york times on the web , please contact alyson\\n racer at alyson @ nytimes . com or visit our online media\\n kit at http : / / www . nytimes . com / adinfo\\n for general information about nytimes . com , write to\\n help @ nytimes . com .\\n copyright 2001 the new york times company',\n",
       " \"Subject: update on retention & severance plan\\n we know how interested all of you are in the retention & severance plan , so we want to update you on its status .\\n as many of you know , we have been working with members of the creditors ' committee and their consultants since december to formulate a retention & severance plan , and we formally presented the plan to the committee on friday , february 22 . we had hoped the committee would approve the plan quickly so that we could file it with the bankruptcy court and share the details of the plan with you before the end of the month .\\n we know that many of you have career options outside of enron and that the retention & severance plan may impact your decision to stay or to leave . we sincerely regret to inform you that approval of the plan for debtor companies is delayed . we ' re learning that , in bankruptcy , most things don ' t move as quickly as we are accustomed .\\n the committee outlined some concerns related to our proposed plan , but we are confident we will be able to reach agreement with the creditors on those concerns . the creditors ' committee fully supports the implementation of a retention & severance plan . such plans align the company ' s objectives with the goals of the creditors and are fairly standard in bankruptcy . these plans are designed as a way to preserve and maximize value for the estate .\\n the creditors ' committee also understands that time is of the essence for getting a plan in place and has established a subcommittee to expedite their review and approval process . to that end , we are meeting regularly with the subcommittee . we intend to work hand - in - hand with them to reach agreement on an acceptable plan as quickly as possible . this is currently our top priority , bar none !\\n when we filed for bankruptcy , we did not fully grasp how tedious the process of developing an acceptable plan would be . unfortunately , that lack of understanding led management to set unrealistic expectations about how quickly a plan might be in place .\\n we now know that it takes significant time , resources and effort to understand , identify and gather the massive volume of required details , to formulate that information into a reasonable program , and to prepare a rationale and compelling presentation . the process mirrors the most time - intensive business presentation or deal negotiation with which enron has been involved . that serves only as an explanation - it is not intended as an excuse .\\n we remain committed to working with the creditors ' committee until we can reach agreement on a plan . we anticipate that negotiation process will take another week or so , and have targeted the week of march 11 to file a motion to adopt a plan with the bankruptcy court . we will continue to hold retention and severance as our number one priority until a plan is approved by the bankruptcy court .\\n with respect to non - debtor companies , or those companies not in bankruptcy , new severance plans are being approved and will be rolled out to employees in those companies in the very near future .\\n in the meantime , we have been working to finalize merit increases and promotions across the entire organization and plan to communicate those to employees next week .\\n and of course , we will update you on retention and severance as soon as possible .\",\n",

       " 'Subject: fw :\\n another mention\\n then , at an afternoon meeting of employees in the company \\' s core natural gas and electricity trading operation , which provides by far the biggest part of enron \\' s profits , \\' \\' quite a bit of concern was raised about the news people had been seeing about this change - of - control payment , \\' \\' mark palmer , an enron spokesman , said .\\n at about 4 p . m . central time , two senior executives who had attended the meeting , john lavorato and louise kitchen , told mr . lay about the reaction of employees . \\' \\' ken made a decision shortly thereafter that the best thing to do would be to waive the payment altogether , \\' \\' mr . palmer said . even if dynegy \\' s directors later voted to award mr . lay a new severance agreement , he would turn it down , mr . palmer added .\\n - - - - - original message - - - - -\\n from : armstrong , julie\\n sent : wednesday , november 14 , 2001 9 : 22 am\\n to : lohman , tk\\n subject :\\n see about traders\\n 11 / 14 / 2001\\n the wall street journal\\n a 3\\n ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . )\\n enron corp . said its chairman , kenneth lay , has decided to forgo a severance payment of $ 60 . 6 million that could be triggered by dynegy inc . \\' s planned acquisition of enron . mr . lay \\' s decision capped a day in which he appears to have changed his mind on the matter at least twice .\\n early in the day , an enron filing with the securities and exchange commission laid out mr . lay \\' s severance package . by midday , enron indicated that mr . lay would keep only one - third of the payout , which he would take in stock in the combined company , and that he intended to donate one - third to a foundation to help displaced enron employees . the remaining third would cover income - tax liabilities .\\n but by the end of the day , enron spokesman mark palmer said that mr . lay , following a meeting of enron energy traders , had decided against taking any of the severance pay . though mr . lay didn \\' t attend the traders \\' meeting , senior managers told him that \" opinions were expressed that he shouldn \\' t receive the payment , \" mr . palmer said . \" he decided the cleanest thing to do was to waive the payment . \" the opinions of traders carry particular weight because they produce most of enron \\' s profits . questions for mr . lay were directed to mr . palmer , who said he had spoken with mr . lay and other company officials during the day .\\n the initial disclosure about mr . lay \\' s hefty severance payment raised new questions about his willingness to sell enron for a share price that was about a third of the market price of a month ago . last friday , mr . lay even said that enron had other options to the dynegy purchase , which might have allowed the energy company to remain independent , though he declined to elaborate . \" things weren \\' t desperate . . . we had alternatives , \" mr . lay said . the 59 - year - old mr . lay won \\' t have an executive position at the combined company , though he might be a director .\\n for the 12 months ended aug . 31 , mr . lay received about $ 70 million through the exercise of enron options , according to disclosure reports compiled by thomson financial . last year , mr . lay was paid $ 8 . 3 million in salary and bonus and more than $ 10 million in stock awards and other compensation .\\n enron , the nation \\' s largest energy trader , saw its stock collapse in recent weeks following a series of disclosures about the company \\' s extensive dealings with partnerships run by some of its own officers . those dealings are under investigation by the sec . last friday , enron agreed to be acquired by the far smaller houston - based dynegy for stock , currently valued at about $ 10 . 7 billion . the merger agreement still must be approved by regulators and shareholders of the two companies .\\n separately , the california public employees \\' retirement system , which owns about three million enron and 500 , 000 dynegy shares , said it would oppose the appointment of any current enron board member to the board of a combined company . michael flaherman , chair of calpers investment committee said that it appeared that enron \\' s board \" failed in its responsibility \" to monitor the activities of enron executives .\\n mr . palmer , the enron spokesman , said mr . lay had provisions in his employment contract to protect him against a sudden change in control from 1989 forward . in february 2000 , when enron stock was trading between $ 60 and $ 70 a share and mr . lay was being widely lauded for his performance , he negotiated a bigger severance package than he had previously . last august , when chief executive jeffrey skilling quit unexpectedly , mr . lay assumed mr . skilling \\' s duties and his contract term was extended by two years to dec . 31 , 2005 .\\n under the terms of his contract , mr . lay is entitled to payment of $ 20 . 2 million for every full calendar year left on his employment contract , in the event that his employment terminates within 60 days of a change in control . thus , mr . lay is entitled to three full years of payments , or $ 60 . 6 million .\\n mr . lay , who took charge of the then - houston natural gas co . in 1984 when it was a regional pipeline company , wasn \\' t the only member of his family to benefit from enron \\' s heady rise to a global energy giant . sec filings show that in recent years a sister of mr . lay , sharon lay , and a son , mark lay , received millions of dollars in salary , commissions and bonuses related to ms . lay \\' s travel agency and a paper - products company connected to the younger mr . lay .\\n mr . palmer said it is a \" cheap shot \" to criticize the lay family because the pertinent transactions were reported in several annual proxy statements . \" the contracts were bid out and fairly awarded , \" mr . palmer said . ms . lay said her travel agency , of which she is president and half - owner , had won its enron business through competitive bidding and by providing \" the very best service possible . \" mark lay couldn \\' t be reached for comment .\\n coming on top of disclosures of enron \\' s dealings with partnerships run by its own executives , the relationships between lay family members and the company again raise questions about enron \\' s willingness to keep separate corporate and personal interests . former chief financial officer andrew fastow and possibly other enron executives made millions of dollars from these partnerships .\\n mark lay \\' s dealings with enron date back to 1994 , according to the available sec filings . in may 1997 , mark lay and \" certain other individuals \" who together had been officers , directors or shareholders of a company called paper & print management corp . , or ppmc , entered into employment agreements with an enron unit , enron capital & trade resources , according to enron \\' s 1998 proxy statement . the individuals helped set up \" a clearinghouse for the purchase and sale of finished paper products , \" according to the sec filing . mr . palmer said this effort formed the rudiments of enron \\' s profitable paper and pulp - trading business .\\n as part of the deal , enron agreed to reimburse ppmc $ 1 million for certain expenses . mark lay and his colleagues also agreed to \" convey \" to enron \" certain intangible property rights \" from ppmc .\\n mark lay also got a three - year employment contract from enron as a vice president of enron capital & trade . he got a signing bonus of $ 100 , 000 , a minimum monthly salary of $ 12 , 500 , a minimum annual bonus of $ 100 , 000 for 1997 - 1999 and an option to purchase 20 , 000 enron shares . mark lay is no longer with enron and is now attending a seminary , said mr . palmer .\\n since 1985 , sharon lay \\' s firm , lay / wittenberg travel agency in the park inc . , has provided travel arrangements for employees of enron and its predecessor company . for this work the agency received $ 6 . 8 million from 1996 through 2000 . in an interview yesterday , ms . lay said enron accounted for more than half of her firm \\' s revenue in some years . she said her brother \\' s position was \" more a problem \" than an asset since it led some to assume she hadn \\' t worked hard enough to get enron \\' s business .',\n",

and\\n \\x01 \\x07 provide for rate recovery of up to $ 3 . 5 million in implementation costs .\\n in addition , the draft would unbundle core interstate transportation from\\n rates , eliminate\\n core contribution to noncore interstate transition cost surcharges , eliminate\\n the core subscription\\n option as well as the caps for core aggregation programs . the threshold for\\n participating in\\n core aggregation is reduced , and billing options are offered to core\\n aggregators .\\n bilas \\x01 , draft also warned that the commission may come back in two years to\\n open another\\n investigation into gas competition , taking into account any changes in market\\n conditions .\\n bilas gave a little more insight into his decision in the text of the draft .\\n \\x01\\n we question whether there will be an opportunity for discounting by marketers\\n if more competition is allowed , \\x01 8\\n bilas wrote in the draft decision . \\x01 & with half the state already committed to\\n a\\n restructured competitive natural gas industry , it suddenly seems as if the\\n benefits of such re -\\n structuring to enhance competition are speculative , particularly at this\\n time . with one leg in the\\n water , the current has switched direction and it will be difficult , if not\\n foolhardy , to reach our\\n goals by forging ahead .\\n \\x01 & we choose to take a cautious approach again , \\x01 8 the draft continues . \\x01 & rather\\n than proceeding\\n to unbundle transmission in southern california now , we approve , with\\n modifications , the settle -\\n ment suggesting smaller steps towards a competitive market . additionally , we\\n unbundle core\\n interstate transmission and once again urge the legislature to pass consumer\\n protection legisla -\\n tion aimed at unregulated marketers while we facilitate growth in core\\n aggregation programs . \\x01 8\\n the cpuc would not rule out the unbundling of intrastate transmission and\\n other restruc -\\n turing in the future \\x01 & but believe that at this point in time the certain\\n benefits do not outweigh\\n the costs to most ratepayers . \\x01 8\\n all drafts must be filed 30 days before the meetings at which they will be\\n discussed . the\\n draft decision is currently on the agenda for the cpuc \\x01 , s dec . 21 meeting .\",\n",

owned utilities ( ious ) under current retail rates \\x01 * will cover\\n wholesale\\n power market costs incurred by the state . the law reflects the obsession by\\n california lawmakers with avoiding a rate increase rather than focusing on the\\n underlying flaws in california \\x01 , s market structure .\\n ab 1 ushers in several important changes to the california market structure .\\n it\\n also contains several key provisions that capture the political mood in the\\n state . highlights of the bill include\\n * power buying authority transferred . the responsibility for purchasing power\\n for the customers of california \\x01 , s ious has been transferred to the california\\n department of water resources ( cdwr ) . the california utilities will continue\\n to\\n operate and schedule their remaining generating facilities and contracts . the\\n difference between the utilities \\x01 , total load and the sum of their resources\\n ( referred to as the utilities \\x01 , \\x01 & net short \\x01 8 amount ) will be supplied by cdwr ,\\n an\\n amount of energy that varies between 5 , 000 and 25 , 000 megawatts ( mw ) ,\\n depending\\n on the time of year , time of day , and utility plant availability . the\\n utilities\\n most recently performed this function themselves , buying energy from the\\n california power exchange ( px ) . however , cdwr has been buying electricity on\\n behalf of the ious since mid - january , when the near - bankruptcy of southern\\n california edison ( sce ) and pacific gas & electric ( pg & e ) threatened to\\n disrupt\\n supplies to their customers . cdwr is a state agency that manages water\\n reservoirs and transportation systems in the state . cdwr uses an enormous\\n amount of electricity to transport water across california and provides\\n critical load - shedding capability to the independent system operator ( iso ) . in\\n addition , cdwr \\x01 , s reservoirs generate power . the cdwr is thus well integrated\\n in\\n the state \\x01 , s electric grid but in the past has not executed large , complicated\\n energy purchase arrangements to supply the customers of california \\x01 , s\\n utilities .\\n * portfolio of transactions . the intent of ab 1 is to allow cdwr to execute a\\n portfolio of contracts to stabilize the cost of power for the utilities and\\n their customers . cdwr has until january 2 , 2003 , to execute contracts . cdwr\\n will take title to power and is thereby not just acting as a clearinghouse . it\\n has issued a request for bids and seeks a variety of terms , including monthly ,\\n annual , two - year , three - year , and longer . cdwr may also enter into options .\\n thus , although cdwr \\x01 , s role is intended to be temporary , the contracts that it\\n executes could extend many years .\\n * power for munis . cdwr may purchase power on behalf of some california\\n municipal utilities at the municipal utilities \\x01 , election .\\n * new payment scheme . cdwr will be entitled to a portion of existing utility\\n rates to pay for the cost of purchased power , interest on bonds , and\\n administrative expenses . this payment stream will be equal to the difference\\n between the generation component currently embedded in utility retail rates\\n ( averaging about $ 0 . 07 per kilowatt - hour kwh ) and the utilities \\x01 ,\\n costs to run\\n their own generation plants , costs of bilateral and qualifying facility\\n contracts , and the costs of ancillary services . the cdwr share of retail rates\\n is referred to as the california purchase adjustment ( cpa ) . it is not clear\\n whether the cpa will cover wholesale power market costs . current prices for\\n multiyear power contracts may lie above the cpa . in addition , if investors\\n believe that the cpa is inadequate to cover costs , the entire program may be\\n abandoned .\\n * new bonds . bonds will be issued to secure power . the total amount of bonds\\n issued may not exceed four times the cpa . the state will transfer $ 500 million\\n from the general fund to jump - start the program , which begins immediately .\\n this\\n seed money and all bond proceeds must be recovered by cdwr from the california\\n utilities \\x01 , customers ( and municipal utilities if they opt in ) .\\n * new residential rate freeze . the california public utilities commission\\n ( cpuc ) is prohibited from increasing residential customer rates until it has\\n completed paying all outstanding obligations . this locks in the recent 9\\n percent residential rate increase indefinitely . governor gray davis thus keeps\\n his pledge not to increase rates further .\\n * retail competition . to help secure a stable payment stream for the new\\n bonds ,\\n ab 1 enables the cpuc to prohibit the utilities \\x01 , retail customers from\\n choosing\\n an alternative electricity provider until cdwr \\x01 , s obligations are paid .\\n although\\n the cpuc has yet to act on this , the action would effectively halt the\\n competitive retail markets in the state for the duration of the cdwr program .\\n * taxpayer protection . ab 1 directs that the new bonds clearly state \\x01 &\\n neither\\n the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the state of california is\\n pledged\\n to the payment of the principal of or interest on this bond . \\x01 8 thus , the bonds\\n are secured only by the payment stream from utility rates .\\n * no assets affected . the cdwr is granted neither ownership nor control of\\n utility assets .\\n ironically , the authority now granted cdwr is what california utilities had\\n essentially requested last summer when they sought to stabilize electricity\\n prices by executing a portfolio of transactions . the utilities were never\\n provided sufficient authority to execute term contracts . in addition , the\\n utilities have more experience to perform this function than cdwr .\\n rather than aligning retail rates with wholesale electricity prices ,\\n california\\n has sidestepped the issue by simply transferring the electricity purchasing\\n function . sce and pg & e are still left to contend with uncollected costs from\\n past energy purchases , although they will no longer incur costs associated\\n with\\n buying power in the current wholesale market while charging frozen retail\\n rates . the utility liquidity crisis has not been resolved .\\n it is not clear whether the law \\x01 , s prohibition on rate increases for\\n residential\\n customers can be achieved . the law is silent on rate increases for commercial\\n and industrial customers , providing a potential path for recovering\\n higher - than -\\n expected costs . alternatively , cdwr could conceivably find contracts of\\n sufficient duration and low enough price that the rate pledge is met . these\\n contracts would lock in today \\x01 , s retail rates for a long period of time .\\n ab 1 is just one of the steps that state officials hope will restore the power\\n system in california to a more stable footing . key tasks remain .\\n * california \\x01 , s wholesale market structure , which helped cause the supply\\n crisis\\n by ensuring that it was not profitable or possible to build generation in\\n california , remains unchanged . the term contracts cdwr is likely to sign will\\n provide a mechanism for mainly existing generators to lay off risk but will\\n not\\n be sufficient to encourage the build of sufficient new facilities . in\\n addition ,\\n california \\x01 , s siting and permitting process remains largely unchanged .\\n * the state must still address the need to expedite the development of new\\n power plants .\\n * ab 1 does not provide for the recovery of uncollected past wholesale energy\\n costs of california \\x01 , s utilities . the state has been negotiating a deal with\\n the\\n utilities that may involve the transfer of generation or transmission assets\\n to\\n the state . however , the utilities have achieved recent court victories that\\n may\\n pave the way to a court - directed recovery of these costs . recent audits\\n indicate that sce and pg & e recovered their stranded costs early in 2000 , which\\n should have triggered an end to their respective rate freezes . a legal\\n showdown\\n between the utilities and the state on this issue may be inevitable .\\n * * end * *\\n follow above url for full report .\\n come shoot the rapids with us at ceraweek 2001 , \" shooting the rapids :\\n strategies and risks for the energy future \" in houston , february 12 -

       " 'Subject: the storm arrives - cera alert\\n update from cera on pricing and rest of the season .\\n - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by lorna brennan / et withdrawal rates decline with\\n inventory as field pressure is reduced .\\n * pressure in the market will be reinforced and\\n extended through 2001 and probably into 2002 . during the\\n past two summers , high prices have been required to\\n discourage demand and allow overall us storage\\n injections to reach barely 1 . 6 trillion cubic feet\\n ( tcf ) . if normal weather holds for the remainder of this\\n winter , 2 . 2 tcf of injections - which would be nearly\\n impossible to achieve - would be required during 2001 if\\n inventories are to recover to 2 . 7 tcf at peak . if\\n weather this winter is merely normal from mid - december\\n through march , going into winter next year the united\\n states will have considerably less gas in storage .\\n reaching even the 2 , 362 bcf level , according to cera\\n estimates ( see table 1 ) , would require an additional 275\\n bcf of injections next year , and that alone would prove\\n challenging .\\n price - the cold weather path\\n the weakness of storage inventories and the demand\\n pressure in both core and power generation markets\\n created by the cold weather have caused prices to move\\n onto and even above cera \\' s cold weather path for this\\n winter ( see table 2 ) . storage inventories would become\\n perilously low if the current forecast for cold weather\\n through mid - december proves accurate , and the injections\\n required next summer would keep pressure in the market\\n intense . for these reasons cera \\' s outlook for prices for\\n january and throughout 2001 now reflects the cold\\n weather path . prices could take an even higher path ,\\n particularly if colder - than - normal weather endures\\n beyond mid - december or returns on a sustained basis in\\n january or february .\\n several forces that could weaken prices during 2001 will\\n begin to enter the market during the winter , but these\\n are offset by demand volatility in the winter and the\\n requirement to rebuild storage inventories once the\\n winter is over . such factors include a building us\\n supply capability , growing imports , softening oil prices\\n ( allowing a lower floor for prices once the winter\\n ends ) , and potentially weakening economic growth .\\n although the influence of these factors will increase ,\\n it is unlikely to match the huge injection requirement\\n that appears more and more certain next summer .\\n demand - the difficult next round of switching\\n with gas prices hitting new record highs , cera expects\\n some additional demand to be priced out of the market .\\n because gas has priced above residual fuel oil for most\\n weeks since may , however , the easiest fuel switching in\\n the power generation and industrial sectors has already\\n occurred . even though gas prices are currently above the\\n level of distillate ( approximately $ 7 . 23 per mmbtu in\\n new york ) , switching from gas to distillate requires\\n changes in long - standing consumer habit , will occur only\\n over time , and is likely limited in volume . significant\\n switching to distillate would quickly raise the price of\\n distillate itself .\\n there are four major sources of additional demand\\n response in industrial markets :\\n * additional switching to resid in industrial boilers .\\n the next increment of demand to come out of the market\\n is likely to be in the industrial sector , through\\n additional fuel switching to resid ( and to some extent\\n to distillate ) . these markets will continue to show some\\n flexibility but will not represent a large volume . cera\\n estimates that the industrial boiler market has probably\\n already begun to lose small amounts ( less than 0 . 5 bcf\\n per day ) in switching to resid , given the consistency of\\n gas price premiums greater than $ 0 . 50 per mmbtu .\\n * investment in restoring switching capability . as\\n premiums move far beyond this level , industrial end\\n users can be expected to take a closer look at\\n reinvigorating their switching capability beyond their\\n initial short - term levels . however , such a change would\\n require investment by industrial end users and the\\n availability of resid in oil markets . cera estimates\\n that with focused investment over the course of a number\\n of months to perhaps a year , switching to resid could\\n eventually reach as high as 1 . 3 bcf per day . there is\\n already some movement here ; given the impact of high gas\\n prices on earnings , energy prices have already begun to\\n receive management attention .\\n * switching to distillate . us department of energy data\\n suggest that industrial end users have a theoretical\\n capability of switching nearly 1 . 3 bcf per day to\\n distillate in the short term . this switch would\\n represent additional distillate demand of over 200 , 000\\n barrels per day ( bd ) in a us market of 3 . 8 million\\n barrels . this marginal demand would move the distillate\\n price in tandem with gas price , and any additional\\n switching among power generators to distillate would\\n reinforce this price correlation . in addition , the\\n availability of distillate inventories on site should\\n restrict the quick switching to short periods of time\\n and will not offer a long - term solution to tight\\n markets .\\n * shutting down industrial plants . also offering some\\n flexibility is the shutdown of manufacturing plants that\\n use gas as a feedstock . the major feedstock consumers\\n are the ammonia and methanol industries , and , not\\n surprisingly given the tight margins available ,\\n manufacturers of ammonia and of methanol continue to\\n show suppressed gas demand . however , in the short term\\n only a portion of ammonia production is at risk . whereas\\n the production needs of merchant facilities along the\\n gulf coast is relatively readily replaced by imports ,\\n substitution becomes more difficult away from the coast\\n ( because of transportation logistics ) and for facilities\\n whose production is linked to value - added fertilizer\\n products . hence , cera still estimates that even with\\n nonexistent margins , substantial ammonia production\\n would continue , with additional losses of perhaps 200\\n million cubic feet ( mmcf ) per day of potential demand in\\n addition to the facilities that have already closed .\\n extraordinarily high gas prices will also hasten the\\n shuttering of north american methanol capacity , putting\\n at risk another 100 to 200 mmcf per day of gas demand\\n for that sector .\\n switching that could occur in boiler use is concentrated\\n in the chemicals , paper , and refining sectors in the\\n south and the food products sector in the midwest .\\n continuing feedstock losses would be concentrated in the\\n south central region . for process users , even\\n extraordinarily high gas prices are expected to have\\n little impact on the use of gas in the short term .\\n energy costs are not the dominant component of\\n production costs for these users , and a physical\\n changeover would be time - intensive and elemental in its\\n impact on end - use product quality .\\n the northeast - cold weather operations begin\\n all of the northeast pipelines have issued notices to\\n customers that they either have imposed , or are highly\\n likely to need to impose , transportation restrictions of\\n various types . the most common restriction is to\\n nonprimary firm services ( secondary and interruptible\\n type services ) , which will be scheduled for the next\\n several days on many pipelines . other pipelines have\\n issued balancing requirements whereby receipts and\\n deliveries must match . even hourly flow orders have also\\n been implemented .\\n these actions are normal for winter operations when a\\n cold period is expected . whereas the firm market for\\n natural gas is rarely affected by these restrictions ,\\n the spot market becomes much more volatile as\\n interruptible supplies dry up . the spot market ,\\n primarily made up of nonfirm customers , has had a\\n dramatic reaction to the diminished availability of\\n delivered spot gas into the market area , as has been\\n reflected by the volatility of the cash market this\\n week . the result of these restrictions of nonprimary\\n firm services has been an expansion of basis to henry\\n hub . at one point , gas for next - day delivery to new york\\n traded near $ 24 . 00 per mmbtu delivered , although the\\n average price was closer to $ 14 . 20 . these high spikes\\n are the result of very thinly traded volumes of gas .\\n although these restrictions will likely ease as\\n temperatures return closer to normal , cera now expects\\n basis into the new york citygate to average $ 1 . 31 per\\n mmbtu for december and $ 1 . 36 per mmbtu for january .\\n * * end * *\\n follow url for pdf version of this alert with associated tables .\\n come shoot the rapids with us at ceraweek 2001 , \" shooting the rapids :\\n strategies and risks for the energy future \" in houston , february 12 - 16 ,\\n 2001 ! for more information and to register , please visit\\n http : / / www . cera . com / ceraweek /\\n this electronic message and attachments , if any , contain information\\n from cambridge energy research associates , inc .

       " \"Subject: interesting article\\n interesting article , especially since it came from britain . . . it does\\n mention enron too .\\n the next global city ?\\n the blob that ate east texas\\n jun 21 st 2001\\n houston\\n from the economist print edition ( june 23 , 2001 )\\n for most outsiders , texas is a foreign country . its biggest city , though ,\\n might surprise the rest of the world\\n when a texan in a big hat tells you how wonderful his home town is , reach\\n for the salt . bob lanier , the former mayor of houston , isn ' t actually\\n wearing a stetson as he gazes from his penthouse down on a city that sprawls\\n 25 miles away in every direction . but metaphorically he is . houston , he\\n claims , could become one of the great cities of the world . the remarkable\\n thing is that he might be right .\\n from the time the city was founded in 1836 until the 1970 s , houston doubled\\n in size almost every decade . then , despite one of the deepest slumps any\\n city had experienced since the 1930 s , the metropolitan area managed to add lm people in the 1990 s to grow to 4 . 7 m , making houston the fourth - largest\\n city in america . it is already bigger than berlin and , with a gdp of around\\n $ 215 billion a year , has a larger economy than hong kong . because it is the\\n nearest metropolis to the cities of northern mexico , it may attract another\\n 2 m people over the next two decades , which would give it almost the same\\n size of population as london has now . but a global city ? these are few and\\n far between . houston can hardly dream of becoming a global financial centre\\n like london , new york or tokyo . but its business leaders think it could\\n become a cosmopolitan , entrepreneurial hub , a hong kong , a san francisco or\\n even a new los angeles . it shares la ' s smog , its sprawl , its latino culture ,\\n even its ugly hubris ; and by some measures it surpasses la ' s ability to\\n reinvent its economy . can it use its adaptability to turn itself into a\\n properly international place ?\\n oil be there for you\\n its hopes still depend disproportionately on its most global industry .\\n energy accounts for half of houston ' s economy . during the 1970 s , while the\\n rest of america stagflated , houston boomed as high oil prices sucked\\n billions into the country ' s oil capital . in that decade alone , the city\\n built almost as much new office space as the total amount of commercial\\n property available in san francisco . money was being lent and business plans\\n formed on the assumption that oil would go to $ 50 a barrel . at the height of\\n the boom , about 80 % of the city ' s economy was oil - related . the bust was\\n traumatic . by the mid - 1980 s , all that new office space stood empty . every\\n big local bank was taken over . only one of the property developers then in\\n business is left .\\n unsurprisingly , a certain paranoia lingers in the city about the oil\\n business . the greater houston partnership , the main business lobby , has\\n spent the past 20 years frantically encouraging the city to diversify . yet\\n the fact is that the energy business and houston itself have emerged\\n stronger from the terrible bust . as company after company was forced to cut\\n back , they collapsed their operations back into houston and seem unlikely to\\n be dispersed again . in 1999 , when oil slumped to $ 10 a barrel and the number\\n of oil rigs in america fell to its lowest point in living memory , houston\\n still managed to add energy jobs . now another boom is in prospect , with oil\\n prices high again . matt simmonds , the head of a local energy consultancy ,\\n argues that america ' s past reluctance to build new power plants will force\\n it to increase energy capacity by around 30 % in the next ten or 15 years .\\n the rig count is already 50 % above last year , and natural gas exploration is\\n soaring . if oil prices stay high ( a big if ) and if other countries share\\n america ' s energy worries , houston will grow in importance .\\n it is hampered by a wild - catting reputation . in fact , the energy business is\\n changing in three significant ways , and houston is the centre of all of\\n them . first , technology . not long ago , oil drills went down to 1 , 500 feet\\n ( 457 metres ) . now they go to 15 , 000 feet . companies use four - dimensional\\n computer imaging to plan new fields ( time is the fourth ) . this is making oil\\n an information - intensive business and puts a premium on the kinds of skills\\n available in houston . second , the cost of new oilfield exploration and\\n development has risen so far that even newly merged behemoths cannot always\\n finance them alone . this makes deal - making vital , which is good for the city\\n where deals are made . if you are not attending , say , lunch at houston ' s\\n petroleum club , you are out of the loop . third and most important , oil is\\n now only part of a bigger energy business , which includes electricity . once\\n divided into self - contained regional markets run by local utilities , the\\n electricity business is being changed by the gradual emergence of a national\\n grid dominated by power producers and traders . big users now decide whether\\n to buy power at long - or short - term rates , rather as they arrange their\\n financing . a new business of energy arbitraging is emerging , and itscentre\\n is houston .\\n three of the five new skyscrapers going up downtown have as their main\\n tenants energy companies that did not exist ten years ago . one of them ,\\n enron , is building a 50 , 000 - square - foot trading floor ? ? single - company\\n answer to the chicago board of trade . enron has probably been houston ' s\\n most successful energy company of the past ten years . it has never explored\\n for , pumped up , or refined a single drop ofoil . out of the black stuff\\n however well - placed houston is to take advantage of the energy business , it\\n will never be a great city as a one - trick pony . its boosters point to other\\n strengths :\\n * trade . houston is america ' ssecond largest port , which is remarkable\\n considering it is 50 miles from the sea .\\n * computers . the city is home to compaq , america ' s third - largest pc maker . if\\n you include dell , based in austin , two of america ? ? four big computer firms\\n are in south - east texas , not silicon valley .\\n * space . the national aeronautics and space administration centre is in\\n houston , thanks to lyndonjohnson , a native son .\\n * medicine . houston is home to probably the largest medical complex in the\\n world . in a moment of extraordinary optimism , the city set aside 700 acres\\n in the middle of town for medicine . the hospitals , clinics and research\\n centres of the texas medical centre employ 55 , 000 people and deal with\\n 70 , 000 patients a day . st luke ' s has performed more heart surgery than any\\n other hospital in the world . md anderson and the texas children ' s hospital\\n are among the top two in their respective specialities , cancerand\\n paediatrics .\\n this list has holes in it . houston has no real financial services ( the\\n mainstay of the biggest global cities ) or pharmaceuticals ( despite the\\n medical centre ) . and some of its new industries are less robust than the\\n boosters claim . its port ' s success depends on the vagaries of mexico ' s\\n economy . space does not employ many people and is unlikely to grow until the\\n far - off day when the commercialisation of space arrives . the texas medical\\n centre is set up on a not - for - profit basis , so it has not been able to\\n commercialise its activities ( hence the lack of drug firms ) , though a new\\n biotechnology park may help . in fact , houston ' s main hope for diversifying\\n lies not so much in particular sectors as in something intangible : its\\n stunning ability to create new firms . for the past three years , houston has\\n created more new companies than any city in america . it is almost certainly\\n the best place either to start a business or find a first - time job . the\\n reasons for this are the real driving forces behind its success . the beauty\\n of entrepreneurialism\\n the first is unmeasurable , a no - holds - barred optimism of the old school . one\\n survey shows that about two - thirds of americans agree with the assertion\\n that if you work hard in this city , eventually you will succeed . but\\n houston ' s figure even at the bottom of the city ' s recession was 75 % , and now\\n it is 88 % , the highest - ever , and ( says the survey ' s author , stephen\\n klineberg of rice university ) the highest of any bigamerican city .\\n it may not be true that anything is possible in houston , but people act as\\n if it were . bill gilmer , the chief economist of the houston branch of the\\n federal reserve system , argues that this explains why houston recovered so\\n fast from the oil bust : unemployed engineers went out and set up their own\\n firms , just as aerospace engineers did in los angeles when the end of the\\n cold war put them out of business . the second advantage is technical .\\n uniquely for an american metropolis , houston has no citywide zoning\\n ordinances . when planning decisions are made , they are made by developers on\\n their own land . for the would - be entrepreneur , it is thus easier and cheaper\\n to find a place to set up shop in houston than in any other city in america .\\n lack of zoning laws hands power to developers who insist that new\\n developments be large to capture economies of scale . they expand in leapfrog\\n fashion , ignoring small 20 - acre plots near the city centre in favour of vast\\n planned towns further out . this drives land prices sharply down , especially\\n the further you go from the centre . on top of that , an aversion to red tape\\n makes it easy to get building permits . barton smith , a land economist at the\\n university of houston , reckons lack of red tape is at least as important to\\n keep costs low as lack of zoning laws .\\n lack of zoning also makes neighbourhoods slightly more mixed in terms of\\n usage ( residential and commercial are more muddled up than elsewhere ) and\\n racially . because there are no zoning laws to force , say , a bankrupt\\n restaurant to re - open as a restaurant , areas change shape quickly . at the\\n same time , houston is less segregated racially than any other city , bymost\\n measures .\\n one should not be over - impressed by this . whites in houston may be more\\n likely than their peers elsewhere to have had a conversation with someone of\\n a different race in the previous week , but that hasn ' t stopped them heading\\n for the suburbs . much of the racial mixture downtown is of blacks , latinos\\n and asians ( the city has america ' s second - largest vietnamese settlement\\n after southern california ) . but because zoning laws do not enable local\\n groups to keep poor people out ( for example , by requiring that all housing\\n plots be huge ) , houston remains racially desegregated by american standards .\\n this helps draw in immigrant workers , creating a pool of labour .\\n that leads to the third of houston ' s main characteristics which should prove\\n an advantage in the 21 st century : racial tolerance . houston looked like a\\n southern town until the 1970 s : white , with a large black minority . a\\n generation later , its population is roughly one - third white , one - third black\\n and ( slightly over ) one - third brown . other cities have similar profiles but\\n none went from a bi - racial to amulti - racial city quite so abruptly .\\n even more strikingly , it did so peacefully . houston has not had a race riot\\n since 1914 . for the largest southern city to have gone through the\\n civil - rights era and its aftermath without upheaval is a remarkable comment\\n on its politics . minorities have long been fully or over - represented in the\\n city council , county commissions and the texas state legislature . bob stein\\n of rice university argues that , unlike other growing cities , houston is\\n reinventing the tradition of a powerful group of civic - minded business\\n leaders , the fate of whose companies is closely tied to that of the city .\\n ken lay , enron ' s chairman , is an example . he has been the driving force\\n behind the building of two sports stadiums , and has a pet project to boost\\n child literacy . rumour has it that he may run for mayor . the effect of this\\n sort of civic - minded activism showed up in the late 1990 s . at a time when\\n america was busily abolishing affirmative - action programmes , houston went\\n the other way : it had a new one approved in a city - wide referendum . for\\n better or worse , this showed how racially tolerant it is . for how much\\n longer ?\\n in many ways , houston is thriving because it has kept alive an\\n old - fashioned , industrial mode of growth , built on cheap land , low taxes ,\\n immigrant labour and unfettered pro - business policies . this model may not be\\n enough in the next decades .\\n houston is ugly . it was hardly charming to begin with and has pulled down\\n many of its old buildings . it may have to pull down even more after recent\\n floods caused $ 2 billion - worth of damage . it is also , as al gore rudely\\n pointed out during the presidential campaign , polluted . since cities now\\n have to attract skilled workers with quality of life benefits , this is a big\\n problem , and not one that can be overcome by cheap housing .\\n business leaders are frantically trying to catch up . in an unusual example\\n of bipartisanship , a fervently conservative property developer has joined\\n forces with a former member of the clinton administration to back a $ 500 m\\n bond issue to plant lm trees . the greater houston partnership has executed\\n an about - turn on pollution . having argued last year that new pollution\\n controls damage growth , it is now on a crash course to cut ozone - creating\\n emissions as fast as it can . if this sudden change of mind is real , it\\n poses a tough question about zoning . houston has 2 , 300 people an acre ,\\n compared with 6 , 000 in los angeles and 20 , 000 in new york ( at the other end\\n of the scale ) . this extraordinary extensiveness is expensive . at one point\\n in the early 1990 s , houston alone was spending more on roads than any state\\n except california ( and , of course , texas ) .\\n there are doubts about how much further sprawl can go . three - quarters of the\\n best - paid jobs are still on or within the inner ring road . some new suburbs\\n are 50 miles away . can the city continue to burst outwards while attracting\\n the skilled people whose jobs are downtown ? and surely that means\\n introducing zoning ? lastly , houston faces a severe problem in the one area\\n where its national reputation is high : education . to run his number - one\\n priority , mr bush picked as secretary of education rod paige , a former head\\n of the houston independent school district . the president claimed ,\\n correctly , that mr paige had overseen substantial improvements in the city ' s\\n education , especially among minorities . what he did not say is that these\\n improvements have been nothing like enough . despite successes in individual\\n schools , half of all latinos fail to graduate from high school , compared\\n with 10 % of whites and 20 % of blacks . whites are abandoning houston ' s public\\n schools . they represent only 12 % of pupils ; 54 % are latino . more than a\\n quarter of today ' s schoolchildren are likely to dropout .\\n in a world where a good job depends on having a college degree , this is\\n alarming . rice university ' s mr klineberg argues that new immigrants from\\n mexico arrive lagging further behind the rest of the country educationally\\n than did the wave of immigrants in the early 1900 s . the first wave took\\n several generations to catch up . today ' s immigrants will have to close a\\n bigger gap more quickly . if they do not , they may end up in an underclass\\n that could scratch at houston ' sracial harmony .\\n this is houston\\n can houston make it ? the city has experienced the three big transformations\\n that affect america in their purest form : the change from a raw - material\\n economy to services ; the change from a bi - racial to a multi - racial place ;\\n and the moderation of a no - holds - barred pro - business culture to take account\\n of environmental and social costs . elsewhere , these changes have occurred\\n over 50 years . houston has lived through them in 20 . and the next 20 years\\n will probably be just as dramatic and successful . hold onto those stetsons .\\n copyright ? ? 1995 -

flows on pgt out\\n of alberta have averaged nearly 2 . 2 bcf per day this month . export capacity\\n out of the region on pge gt nw is running close to capacity , and pipeline\\n constraints to the south combined with strong california demand are driving\\n the wide malin - to - topock differentials .\\n continuing strong demand in the south will likely keep topock prices strong ,\\n and the wide north - south differentials within the west will likely hold\\n through september . in the pacific northwest demand is expected to climb\\n through september to 1 . 5 bcf per day from 1 . 4 bcf per day in august . this\\n demand level should keep malin differentials from widening from current\\n levels . for september cera expects malin prices to average $ 0 . 10 per mmbtu\\n below the henry hub price .\\n southwest\\n prices in the san juan basin this summer have been left behind by rising\\n california demand . although the westward pull on supplies is strong ,\\n bottlenecks between california and the san juan have led to disconnects\\n between san juan prices and topock prices . pipeline capacity utilization\\n rates on transwestern and the northern leg of el paso reached 93 percent\\n during july , with less than 200 mmcf per day of excess pipeline capacity .\\n increased flows from the rockies on transcolorado and northwest are\\n contributing to downward pressure on san juan basin supply , and in general ,\\n the san juan has followed rocky mountain prices rather than following prices\\n at topock or the permian basin .\\n unlike in the past two summers , the bottleneck has not allowed power demand\\n on the west coast to support san juan prices relative to permian prices . the\\n differential between san juan and permian has averaged $ 0 . 50 per mmbtu so far\\n this month and $ 0 . 30 per mmbtu since june . additional imports from the\\n rockies into the san juan have increased supply by 200 mmcf per day relative\\n to last summer , but these higher flows do not fully explain the disconnect .\\n without much change in southwestern or rocky mountains local demand , the san\\n juan should continue to price at a wide discount during september . the san\\n juan - to - henry hub differential is expected to average $ 0 . 60 per mmbtu . as in\\n the rockies , differentials should narrow substantially in october .\\n rocky mountains\\n downward pressures on rocky mountain prices intensified over the past month\\n as utilization rates on pipelines out of the region continued to climb .\\n record heat and power generation levels have done little to boost gas demand\\n within the region ; generation is still largely coal - based , and the demand\\n impact on gas of the additional load is minimal . cera expects the heavy\\n discount - current rocky mountain - to - henry hub differentials are around $ 0 . 90\\n per mmbtu - to persist through september . local area demand is not expected to\\n change during september . substantial gain in local demand comes in october\\n with heating loads ; october demand should average 1 . 4 bcf per day , up from\\n august and september averages of around 1 . 2 bcf per day .\\n although the winter heating season will relieve pipeline pressures in the\\n rockies , winter differentials are expected to stay in the $ 0 . 25 to $ 0 . 40 per\\n mmbtu range . strong storage inventories will limit the connection with\\n broader north american markets this summer . next summer , pressures on rockies\\n supplies will likely intensify relative to this summer . although pipeline\\n expansion projects have been announced - trailblazer and williams announced\\n expansion plans this summer - the new capacity will not be online to relieve\\n constraints next summer . cera expects supplies within the rocky mountains to\\n increase by 300 mmcf per day next year .\\n western canada\\n after widening to over us $ 1 . 50 per mmbtu , the aeco - henry differential has\\n begun to narrow somewhat ; maintenance that has restricted flows has largely\\n been responsible for the jump from $ 0 . 84 per mmbtu in july . with current\\n supply able to fill the contracted pipe capacity and incremental volumes\\n having to pay full cost to flow , differentials are likely to persist in the\\n mid - us $ 0 . 70 s per mmbtu for september . aeco is expected to be us $ 3 . 25 per\\n mmbtu ( c $ 4 . 53 per gigajoule ) for september . even with the start - up of the\\n alliance project , the contract nonrenewal on transcanada is likely to\\n continue the two - tiered pricing dynamics of contracted versus uncontracted\\n pipeline costs . this will result in differentials that will range between\\n us $ 0 . 60 and us $ 0 . 75 per mmbtu throughout the winter .\\n supply build in western canada continues to languish behind last year ' s\\n levels . the pace of drilling ( over 9 , 000 gas wells are expected this year )\\n should provide growth in the fourth quarter and into 2001 . supply is expected\\n to be flat with 1999 on an annual basis for this year and up at least 350\\n mmcf per day in 2001 .\\n sumas prices have been quite volatile , driven by both weather in the pacific\\n northwest and maintenance on the westcoast system . for september , sumas is\\n expected to be slightly more stable and to price at a modest premium to aeco\\n of us $ 0 . 05 per mmbtu .\\n * * end * *\\n follow url for pdf version of this monthly briefing with associated graphic\\n and tables .\\n cera ' s autumn 2000 roundtable event dates and agendas are\\n now available at http : / / www . cera . com / event\\n account changes\\n to edit your personal account information , including your e - mail\\n address , etc . go to : http : / / eprofile . cera . com / cfm / edit / account . cfm\\n this electronic message and attachments , if any , contain information\\n from cambridge energy research associates , inc .

line gc data is used as pipeline quality of gas in panhandle lateral because gs report from owens corning delivery point is quite similar to agave gc , 2 ) gas temperatures will become nearly the same as ground temperatures which is provided on scada at p - 1 and p 2 3 ) pressure and temperature profiles on the panhandle lateral at 6 / 14 , 9 : 00 am flowing conditions are listed below\\n the following graph ( attached in ms word ) is a phase envelope using the agave red bluff gas analysis . by mapping the above relative pressure / temperature points it is clearly observed that pipeline pressure and temperature conditions approach and cross the hydrocarbon dewpoint line indicating that liquids would exist .\\n the graph clearly shows that as the pressure and temperatures move further into the envelope the more liquids will be produced . that explains why more liquids are produced by pigging sections between cs p - 2 and cs p - 3 . furthermore , using the process model used to generate the phase envelope , the model indicates that gas at 800 psig and 65 degf would exist in both vapor and liquid phases . using a flow rate of 100 mmcfd the liquid phase fraction would be approximately 80 bbls . per day that could amount to approximately 2400 bbls . per month . this liquid volume compares closely to some of the recovery volumes reported by randy and walt below .\\n lets get together on a conference call to further discuss findings and possible solutions . for a first stab , how about tuesday , 6 / 19 , at 8 : 00 am ( cst ) ? reply with availability and number of ports required . ef 713 / 853 -

2 to p - 3\\n thanks randy . along with the things you have stated we have a delivery point to gas company of new mexico near portales , nm . we do have a small scrubber there that we usually have to have hauled once a week and sometimes a couple of times . the ( owens - corning ) delivery can and will get us in trouble sooner or later if we don ' t get a handle on liquids . i have ask eric faucheaux to take a look at the system and give us some ideas on where most of the liquid is falling out .\\n i have talked with ( agave ) the producer about this and we ' re working together to try and figure out what ' s going on . we can pick up water on our instruments but there ' s not anything that we know of that will show condensate . this has to be carrying through in the gas because there ' s not a large amount of liquids at the delivery point . the best solution at this time is to get enough gas to pig the line more often . after getting the liquid in at p - 3 we ran a pig from roswell to p - 1 and it came in dry . as soon as the volumes come up we ' ll run from p - 1 to p - 2 then into p - 3 . thanks for everyone ' s help in this . if we need a conference call to discuss let me know .\\n it had been about six weeks between pig runs this time . total received on the system was about three thousand barrels this time . the time before this run we received about six thousand barrels .\\n thanks\\n rj\\n randy lebeau\\n 06 / 12 / 2001 04 : 46 pm\\n to : gary spraggins / et & s / enron @ enron\\n cc : rich jolly / et & s / enron @ enron\\n subject : pigging from p - 2 to p - 3\\n gary , we recently had to run a pig from p - 2 to p - 3 in order to push about 2200 barrels of condensate out of the line . we had started developing problems with some deliveries off that line . apparently , in order to run a pig , some volume has to be routed to that line . i understand that there are some marketing and gas control issues when we do this , but here are some operational concerns when we have to put this off or postpone it :\\n the condensate and fluids tend to build up to the point that they carry over to a delivery point with energas . this point feeds some domestic customers . we don ' t want condensate getting into this point .\\n there is a customer on this line ( owens -

2 to p - 3\\n thanks randy . along with the things you have stated we have a delivery point to gas company of new mexico near portales , nm . we do have a small scrubber there that we usually have to have hauled once a week and sometimes a couple of times . the ( owens - corning ) delivery can and will get us in trouble sooner or later if we don ' t get a handle on liquids . i have ask eric faucheaux to take a look at the system and give us some ideas on where most of the liquid is falling out .\\n i have talked with ( agave ) the producer about this and we ' re working together to try and figure out what ' s going on . we can pick up water on our instruments but there ' s not anything that we know of that will show condensate . this has to be carrying through in the gas because there ' s not a large amount of liquids at the delivery point . the best solution at this time is to get enough gas to pig the line more often . after getting the liquid in at p - 3 we ran a pig from roswell to p - 1 and it came in dry . as soon as the volumes come up we ' ll run from p - 1 to p - 2 then into p - 3 . thanks for everyone ' s help in this . if we need a conference call to discuss let me know .\\n it had been about six weeks between pig runs this time . total received on the system was about three thousand barrels this time . the time before this run we received about six thousand barrels .\\n thanks\\n rj\\n randy lebeau\\n 06 / 12 / 2001 04 : 46 pm\\n to : gary spraggins / et & s / enron @ enron\\n cc : rich jolly / et & s / enron @ enron\\n subject : pigging from p - 2 to p - 3\\n gary , we recently had to run a pig from p - 2 to p - 3 in order to push about 2200 barrels of condensate out of the line . we had started developing problems with some deliveries off that line . apparently , in order to run a pig , some volume has to be routed to that line . i understand that there are some marketing and gas control issues when we do this , but here are some operational concerns when we have to put this off or postpone it :\\n the condensate and fluids tend to build up to the point that they carry over to a delivery point with energas . this point feeds some domestic customers . we don ' t want condensate getting into this point .\\n there is a customer on this line ( owens - corning ) who gets fuel from us . their process is very sensitive to pressure and volume changes . at any given time , i am told that they have about a million dollars worth of material in production . if they lose fuel , the product is lost and we could be liable . i am also told that once the plant goes down , it could take a long time ( even weeks ) to get it back up .\\n the owens -

       " 'Subject: overview of investor conference call\\n today , enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview of the company . here \\' s an update of what we discussed during the call .\\n we told investors that we \\' re doing everything we can to protect their interests and to regain their confidence . our focus remains on our credit quality , balance sheet and liquidity , which are essential for our continued success and expansion of our wholesale businesses .\\n it took more than a few weeks to get where we are today . here \\' s a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation :\\n - - in hindsight , we definitely made some very bad investments in our non - core businesses over the past several years . those include investments in azurix , india and brazil . they have performed far worse that we could have ever imagined when we made these investments ;\\n - - because of these bad investments , we \\' ve become over - leveraged as a company . the negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet ;\\n - - we also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of investor confidence , which has been very damaging ;\\n - - we \\' ve been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard - to - understand financial and operating disclosures ; and\\n - - on top of it all , we discovered errors in our financial statements , as discussed in our 8 - k filing last week , that required a restatement of previously reported earnings .\\n we \\' ve taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas : core businesses , non - core businesses , and businesses under review .\\n core businesses\\n our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant earnings and cash flows for the company . they \\' re our competitive advantage . these include :\\n - - natural gas pipeline businesses ;\\n - - gas and power businesses in north america and europe ;\\n - - retail businesses in north america and europe ; and\\n - - coal businesses in north america and europe .\\n the events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on our projected fourth quarter profitability . it \\' s too early to tell at this time what impact this might have on our operating results . we are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002 .\\n i also remain optimistic that the actions we \\' ve taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns . according to our business unit leaders , we have definitely seen improvement in our counterparty relationships .\\n non - core businesses\\n our non - core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband division . we have invested more than $ 8 billion in these businesses , and the return from them has been dismal .\\n we have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses . we already have more than $ 800 million in assets contracted for sale this year . they include ceg rio , a gas ldc in brazil ; ecoelectrica , a power plant and lng receiving terminal in puerto rico ; and asset sales of offshore oil and gas properties in india . the approximately $ 2 . 9 billion portland general sale is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals .\\n businesses under review\\n these businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and gas wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets . while several of these businesses have very strong future prospects , we need to determine if their capital requirements and near - term growth prospects are sufficient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation .\\n reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force . more information will follow as soon as it becomes available .\\n credit rating / 10 - q filing\\n we continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating . our current credit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows :\\n - - moody \\' s at baa 3 \" under review for further downgrade \"\\n - - fitch at bbb - \" evolving status \"\\n - - s or investor relations , enron corp . , enron building , 1400 smith street , houston , tx 77002 , phone : ( 713 ) 853 - 3956 , fax : ( 713 ) 646 - 3302 .\\n in addition , the identity of the persons who , under sec rules , may be considered \" participants in the solicitation \" of dynegy and enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions , and any description of their direct or indirect interests , by security holdings or otherwise , are available in an sec filing under schedule 14 a made by each of dynegy and enron .',\n",

       " 'Subject: re : capacity posting procedures\\n pursuant to our meeting , i was to check the posting timelines to see if we could make the 1 day category , include 5 months or less rather than less than 5 months . based on a recent decision ( march 16 , 2001 ) in columbia gas transmission co , i think we can . in columbia , the commission approved columbia \\' s proposal to establish an interactive auction process in which firm capacity available for less than one year would be posted for an initial one hour period from 7 : 00 am to 8 : 00 a . m . capacity offered for one year or more would be subject to an initial posting period of 5 days . this indicates movement by the commission to much shorter posting periods for capacity available for less than one year . i think we can modify our procedures to include up to 5 months in the 1 day posting category . however , we may want to consider combining the 3 day category and 1 day category into one 1 day category for capacity offered for less than one year . in addition , for capacity offered for one year or more , columbia will advertise a proposed offer on its ebb one day prior to the five - day posting of the capacity . ( this supports a special posting in advance . ) although it is good to have these internal procedures , what is important to the commission is that pipeline tariffs set forth specific procedures regarding the availability of capacity .\\n the columbia order also gave guidance on when a pipeline has to accept a bid for max rates . columbia proposed that it not be required to sell capacity to shippers bidding the maximum rate for a term of less than 12 months until one day prior to the commencement of gas flow detailed in the auction package . the commission rejected this in favor of the industrials \\' proposal : beginning 30 days before the capacity is available for service , columbia must accept bids at the max rate for a term of five months to less than 12 months . beginning seven days before the capacity is available , columbia must accept maximum rate bids for terms of more than one month to less tha 5 months . columbia must accept maximum rate bids for a term of one month or less one day before gas flows .\\n thanks , maria\\n - - - - - original message - - - - -\\n from : hass , glen\\n sent : wednesday , may 30 , 2001 4 : 32 pm\\n to : harris , steven ; miller , mary kay ; fossum , drew ; dornan , dari ; pavlou , maria ; pryor , tony ; donoho , lindy ; watson , kimberly ; darveaux , mary ; fawcett , jeffery ; lokay , michelle ; lindberg , lorraine ; lohman , tk ; kirk , steve ; paladino , ranelle\\n subject : capacity posting procedures\\n attached for your review is a redlined draft of tw \\' s capacity posting procedure including changes suggested at our meeting yesterday . one remaining item is to decide whether capacity available for \" less than 5 months \" or \" 5 months or less \" will be designated as 1 day postings . please review and advise if you have any additional comments . thanks .\\n gh\\n >',\n",

it ' s the morning of january 29 th and i wanted to take an opportunity to introduce myself and tell you how pleased i am to have been selected as enron ' s interim ceo . my firm , zolfo cooper , my partners and i have assisted hundreds of companies as they have worked their way through the restructuring and reorganization process . i just wanted to give you some of my thoughts about it as we move forward .\\n i can ' t imagine what the past few months have been like for all of you . i ' m sure it ' s been incredibly difficult , particularly with the glare of the media attention and the numerous investigations and inquiries that have been launched and continue to be launched . in that environment , i ' ve got to believe it ' s difficult , if not impossible , for you to focus on what lies ahead for enron and for the organization .\\n i ' m not going to bother to restate what is in the press release announcing my selection and our new management team this morning , however , i ' d like to tell you how we typically approach situations like this .\\n it ' s been the experience of myself , my firm , my partners , that in helping companies emerge from bankruptcy , we look at a number of key metrics to gauge the potential for successful restructurings . those metrics are typically the organization , the asset base that the company has to bring to bear , customer base , and liquidity . from what i ' ve been able to tell over the last couple of days and with my exposure to the management team here , enron has a very , very bright , very capable , very committed , hardworking and dedicated organization . all of the people i have met are committed to reorganize , restructure and bring enron to a successful new beginning and emerge from bankruptcy .\\n number 2 , the physical assets look to me to be of an enormous advantage here . the regulated assets , the pipelines , the generating plants provide steady and reliable cash flow and provide a very sound fundamental base to restructure around .\\n third , loyal customers . most of enron ' s customers have continued to stand by the company and continue to take delivery of natural gas and electricity on a daily basis .\\n and fourth , liquidity looks good with the cash the company has on hand , the cash it expects to generate in the near term , and with the backstop of the dip financing , it doesn ' t appear that we will have any liquidity issues going forward .\\n with those four resources nicely in place , i ' m very confident that we can successfully restructure this company . i don ' t want to leave the impression that it will be easy . it ' s going to be an enormous amount of work . there will be upsets , issues , and concerns along the way . but i can tell you that i ' ve seen companies in bankruptcy that don ' t have nearly as strong a position as this company . they were able to emerge successfully from bankruptcy , and i ' m certain enron will also .\\n i ' m looking forward to working with all of you over the next few months and i ' m very pleased to be here . jeff , ray and i will keep you informed on a regular basis as we move forward . if there are any thoughts , concerns , issues that you would like to bring to my attention , please don ' t hesitate to drop me a note or give me a call .\\n thanks so much , and i look forward to working with all of you .\",\n",

       " 'Subject: maybe tw should build into northern nevada . . . check this article\\n out\\n shippers condemn northwest \\' s must - flow ofos\\n several northern nevada industrial gas users have accused northwest pipeline\\n of violating its tariff by holding them hostage to the daily must - flow\\n operational flow orders ( ofos ) that it has issued since early december in an\\n effort to compensate for the sizable capacity shortfall on its system .\\n in a section 5 complaint filed friday , the industrial gas customers called on\\n ferc to direct northwest to \" cease and desist \" the alleged violation of the\\n tariff , which they claim is forcing them and other customers at the northern\\n end of the pipeline to subsidize the gas acquisition and transportation costs\\n of customers on the southern end of northwest \\' s system .\\n the effect of the must - flow ofos is to compel shippers to make up the\\n capacity shortfall on northwest \\' s system via displacement , the industrials\\n noted . northwest \\' s firm contractual demand is 720 , 000 dth / d , but its physical\\n capacity is only 474 , 000 dth / d . pan - alberta gas ( u . s . ) inc . provides 144 , 000\\n dth / d through a displacement arrangement , while shippers are left to make up\\n the remaining 102 , 000 dth / d .\\n the industrial users contend they shouldn \\' t be penalized for not complying\\n with the must - flow ofos because northwest \\' s tariff exempts shippers that have\\n made \" good faith efforts \" to obtain gas supply , but have been unsuccessful .\\n at issue is whether the \" good faith efforts \" applies to purchasing gas at\\n reasonable costs , which is how the industrials interpret the tariff , or\\n whether it means that shippers should be required to buy gas \" at any price \"\\n to meet a must - flow ofo . the latter , according to the industrial users , is\\n northwest \\' s position .\\n the \" regulatory history \" of northwest \\' s tariff \" makes clear that \\' good faith\\n efforts \\' to obtain a gas supply at the stanfield [ or ] receipt point need not\\n extend to purchasing \\' gas at any price , \\' but rather must be viewed in the\\n context of current conditions and circumstances , i . e . available prices and\\n supplies , \" the industrial customers said . \" where a shipper can secure gas\\n needed to meet a must - flow order only at the basin price differentials that\\n currently prevail , and assuming that the shipper can document such efforts\\n and impacts for northwest verification , the shipper \\' s request for exemption\\n from penalties must be granted . \" northwest twice has refused such a request\\n by the industrial customers , they noted .\\n in anticipation of the high gas prices this month , the nevada industrial\\n users said they chose to switch to alternative fuels \" where feasible \" or to\\n curtail operations rather than use their released capacity on northwest .\\n nevertheless , the pipeline \\' s daily must - flow ofos \" have forced them into the\\n volatile daily gas market to avoid extremely high non - compliance penalties ,\\n undermining their business decisions to rely on alternative fuels , \" they told\\n ferc [ rpol - 189 ] .\\n in order to comply with northwest \\' s orders , the industrials said they \" must\\n ship the gas to a point where they cannot use it , [ and ] can only sell it at\\n the rocky mountain basin prices , which is a fraction of the price at which ,\\n under current conditions , they purchased it . \"\\n the industrial users said they have had to comply with northwest \\' s must - flow\\n ofos , given the hefty penalties they would face otherwise . the penalties are\\n equal to the greater of $ 10 / dth or four times the highest spot rate at sumas ,\\n stanfield , kingsgate , opal or ignacio for the month of non - compliance . based\\n on the spot rate at stanfield , the penalty this month was $ 58 . 15 / dth .\\n if one of the nevada industrial users , newmont mining corp . , had defied\\n northwest \\' s order to flow 25 % of its contract demand , or 1 , 000 / dth , on any\\n december day , it would have been penalized $ 58 , 160 for that one day , they\\n said . if all of the nevada industrial customers had violated the pipeline \\' s\\n order , the one - day penalty would have been $ 149 , 471 .\\n the industrial shippers want ferc to go beyond interpreting the \" good faith\\n efforts \" exemption in their favor . they contend that northwest \\' tariff\\n allowing must - flow ofos \" as currently structured \" is both \" unreasonable and\\n unduly discriminatory . \" that \\' s because it requires one group of shippers , who\\n see no additional benefits , to incur gas acquisition and transportation costs\\n solely to subsidize service to another group of shippers , they argued . they\\n believe the shippers who benefit should pay for the displacement capacity\\n costs .\\n currently , the must - flow ofos \" result in southbound flows [ on northwest ] that\\n create northbound capacity for the benefit of shippers with south - to - north\\n entitlements . those same south - to - north shippers could , however , themselves\\n purchase spot gas in the canadian supply areas and ship such volumes\\n southward on an interruptible basis on northwest , i . e . do what [ the\\n industrial ] shippers and others have been directed to do . they could pay the\\n costs of the capacity that they want . \"\\n as an alternative , northwest could require a sharing of displacement capacity\\n costs by all shippers using its system at a given time when capacity is\\n short , or it could invest in facilities so that it has the physical capacity\\n to meet all of its contractual commitments , the industrial users said .',\n",

- with the switch in ownership , they may be\\n receptive to strategy changes .\\n lorna\\n pancanadian says montana power purchase \\' beautiful fit \\'\\n to extend what it sees as dominance in canada \\' s natural gas market and to\\n boost its production by 10 % , pancanadian petroleum ltd . yesterday agreed to\\n purchase montana power co . for $ 475 million . the properties will extend\\n pancanadian \\' s existing shallow gas properties in southern alberta into\\n northern montana , adding 94 mmcf / d and 3 , 800 barrels of crude oil and natural\\n gas liquids .\\n the acquisition will give pancanadian properties in alberta , montana ,\\n colorado , oklahoma and wyoming , along with three gas pipelines linking\\n alberta and saskatchewan to montana .\\n \" we have a focus on natural gas , \" said ceo david tuer during a conference\\n call yesterday in calgary . \" this is clearly our future . it is difficult to\\n put any negative on this ( acquisition ) and it \\' s likely to stay valuable for\\n the foreseeable future . \"\\n montana power \\' s production is more than 90 % natural gas and associated\\n liquids , and the acquisition substantially extends pancanadian \\' s land and\\n infrastructure , allowing it to use its technology and operating strategies in\\n a region that extends along the alberta - montana border .\\n \" the montana power assets clearly fit our strengths and allow us to employ\\n our expertise in developing long life reserves of shallow and medium depth\\n natural gas , \" tuer said . \" the potential in these assets is significant , and\\n over the next few years , we will add substantially to pancanadian \\' s daily\\n natural gas production . \"\\n tuer said that the acquisition extends the company \\' s dominance in shallow\\n gas , and called montana power a \" beautiful fit with pancanadian \\' s gas\\n strategy , land position and technological capability . \"\\n pancanadian \\' s newest acquisition adds reserves of 550 bcf and 20 mm barrels\\n of oil and natural gas liquids on a proven and one - half probable basis , said\\n officials . production and reserves account for $ 520 million of the purchase\\n price , while the remainder is made up of $ 135 million for the midstream and\\n marketing assets , $ 40 million for the undeveloped land ( about 600 , 000 acres ) ,\\n and $ 7 million of working capital .\\n tuer said the company was paying 77 cents / mcfe of proven and on - half probable\\n reserves . the price for daily flowing production , based on a 6 : 1 ration of\\n gas to boe is $ 4 , 450 / mcfe , or $ 26 , 710 / boe .\\n along with the added alberta and montana properties , pancanadian also picks\\n up some land in colorado \\' s denver basin , which now produces about 31 mmcf / d .\\n other land that is part of the sale is located in the anadarko basin of\\n oklahoma and the green river basin of wyoming .\\n three natural gas pipelines that cross from montana into alberta and\\n saskatchewan also are included . the pipelines allow direct access to the u . s .\\n markets for southern alberta and saskatchewan gas , and serve more than 1 . 2\\n million net acres of developed and undeveloped lands , with most of it\\n concentrated in parcels that span the canada - montana border .\\n midstream assets that go to pancanadian include a natural gas marketing\\n company in butte , mt , along with a deep cut gas processing and fractionation\\n plant in colorado . the fort lupton , co plant processes more than 60 mmcf / d\\n and 5 , 500 barrels of natural gas liquids and condensate .\\n in all , the total developed and undeveloped land is roughly 1 . 2 million net\\n acres , or 1 . 7 million gross acres , said pancanadian .\\n \" montana power fit us like a glove , \" tuer said during the conference call . he\\n said the acquisition will help pancanadian to remain \" best of class \" for what\\n it does . \" it makes our sandbox that much bigger . \"\\n the acquisition , which is expected to close around oct . 31 , will increase\\n both pancanadian \\' s net income and cash flow this year and in subsequent\\n years , said tuer . the added gas production will immediately increase the\\n company \\' s natural gas , as a percentage of total production , to 58 % , based on\\n a 6 : 1 ratio of gas to boe .\\n about 25 % of the natural gas being acquired from montana power now is being\\n sold to montana power utilities for $ 1 . 50 to $ 1 . 60 mmcf until july 2002 , and\\n because it \\' s priced below the open market officials think future earnings\\n will be good .\\n \" as that contract expires , there \\' s a lot of potential from the price in this\\n transaction , \" tuer said .\\n and what \\' s to become of montana power ? earlier this year , the 88 - year - old\\n company , headquartered in butte , announced it would divest itself of four of\\n its traditional energy businesses . by selling its coal production , natural\\n gas transmission and distribution , independent power production and oil and\\n gas exploration and production businesses , it plans to reinvest the proceeds\\n in touch america , a fiber optics and telecommunications business , which is\\n also a subsidiary of montana power .\\n \" the process to determine the buyer for our oil and gas business was robust ,\\n and we are delighted with the result , \" said montana power ceo robert p .\\n gannon . \" we believe there will be a meshing of business strategies and that\\n cultural synergy \\' s exist between the purchased companies and pan canadian . \"\\n he noted that montana power has had a canadian presence for almost 50 years .\\n pancanadian purchased the entire oil and gas division , which now employs\\n about 170 . pancanadian plans to maintain a regional office in butte , invest\\n in the acquired properties and grow daily gas production . there was no word\\n on whether any jobs would be lost .\\n -
